# Chapter 24: The Air That Wants a Spark

The kitchen inhaled me like it had been waiting all night to do it.

The door thudded closed behind my back and the air changed weight. It felt like walking into a room where someone had just been crying, the damp and salt hanging in the corners. The tiles were colder than the hallway, the blue and white pattern crisp under the ring light glow I hadn't even turned on yet. I could taste the gas before I smelled it, a dull metallic sweetness that coated the back of my tongue and turned saliva into pennies.

I told myself it was fine. I told myself it was old pipes. I told myself it was Lisbon, it was Europe, it was character. The things you told yourself when you were already inside.

I set the ring light on the table and twisted it open. The tripod legs clicked against the tile. The sound echoed. Everything echoed in this room. The hiss behind the stove had no echo. It was just there, a line of sound, steady and close, like a secret in someone else's mouth.

I laid my props out in a neat line: espresso cup, saucer, cigarette, lighter. My phone went face-up, camera already open. The screen made my hands look too warm. My fingers had a slight tremor, probably caffeine, probably sleep, probably the fact that the air was heavier than it should have been.

I adjusted the ring light height, swapped to the warmer setting, and stepped back. In the circle of light, the tiles became perfect. The rest of the room fell away. I could almost believe the kitchen was a set, that there was nothing behind the stove except a painted backdrop and a stagehand waiting to call cut.

I didn't want to think about the sound from behind it.

The plant on the windowsill was still dead. Yesterday it had been dead. The day before that too. The leaves had curled into themselves like burned paper. I'd told myself it was because nobody watered it, because hostel life meant you let things dry out and then you left. But the mug of water beneath it was full and brown, and the leaves were the kind of crisp that didn't come from thirst.

I pulled out my phone to check the time. 5:03 AM. The light was still low, but it had that early Lisbon softness. It was the one thing I trusted about mornings here. The light never lied.

My notifications blinked. *BrandRep: Need the cigarette lit. Actual ember. Please.*

Actual ember. Actual. As if the rest of my life wasn't already a series of filtered actualities.

I typed a response and didn't send it. I didn't want to be a person who said no. I wanted to be a person who made things happen.

The hiss sharpened. It didn't get louder, exactly. It got thinner, like the air in the room was tightening around it.

I shook out my hair, adjusted my linen shirt, checked my face in the dark reflection of the stove. The old gas knobs were grimy. Someone had taped a piece of masking tape over the back burner with the word "NO" scrawled on it. I had never respected a "NO" in my life.

I reached for the window latch again, a habit now. My fingers slipped on the paint. The latch didn't move. The paint felt like skin, too smooth to grip. I pulled anyway. The window shuddered but stayed shut. A little dust fell from the frame.

I laughed under my breath. "Cute," I said to the window. The joke came out as a cough.

I set the espresso cup on the table and poured yesterday's coffee into it. It was cold and thin, the color of regret. I didn't need to drink it. I needed it to be there, to steam under the light, to make the image feel like morning instead of a set in a gas-filled room.

The ring light buzzed. I could feel the warmth on my face. It was the only heat in the room that felt safe.

I hit record.

"Good morning," I said to the camera in my posh voice, lifting the cup. "Lisbon is being so Lisbon this morning, you know? Like, tiles and light and little rituals." I breathed in through my nose to make it look content. The gas coated my tongue instead. I kept smiling. "This is my favorite part of the day. It's just me and my coffee and--"

The door creaked open behind me.

I flinched, not at the sound but at the draft. The ring light flickered. The hiss wavered, then settled again.

A tiny woman in a hoodie stepped in, hair in a short bob, eyes still half asleep. She looked at me, then at the stove, then back at me. Her expression was polite and distant, the look of someone who doesn't want to be part of whatever you're doing.

"Oh, sorry," I said, switching to my real voice. "I'm almost done."

She nodded and moved to the shelf, taking down a pot. Her movements were efficient, practiced. She didn't make eye contact again. The kitchen got smaller with two of us in it. The air pressed against my skin like a damp shirt.

"Smell is bad," she said, half to herself, the words clipped. Japanese accent. Yuki. I'd seen her in the dorm, folding clothes with a precision that made my mess feel loud.

"Yeah, the pipes," I said, waving a hand. "Old building." I kept my voice light, a rehearsed line. "It gives it character."

She didn't smile. She filled the pot with water, set it on the front burner, and twisted the knob. The little blue flame flared. The hiss from behind the stove didn't change. I watched the flame dance on the tiles. It looked like a creature in a glass box.

"No back burner," I said automatically, quoting Joana. It felt like something I should say to look responsible.

Yuki nodded and didn't ask why. She pulled a bag of rice from her backpack. Her hands were steady. Mine weren't.

I returned to my phone. The recording had stopped when the door opened, the camera capturing my jolt and an unflattering angle of my chin. I deleted it without watching. I didn't have time for bad takes. I didn't have time for anything that wasn't perfect.

The gas smell rolled thick along the floor. It was heavier than the water in Yuki's pot. It pooled under the table, under my shoes. I felt it creep up my calves like cold fog. I shifted my weight and tried not to think about how much I could smell it now that someone else had said it out loud.

I set the cigarette on the saucer, angled just right. I flicked the lighter open but didn't spark it. The click was loud. Yuki glanced at me, then away. The hiss behind the stove threaded itself through everything, constant and thin.

The door opened again. A tall guy in a football jersey came in, rubbing sleep from his eyes. He went straight to the sink and drank from the tap like he'd been running a marathon. Water dripped down his chin. He saw the ring light and raised his eyebrows.

"Morning," he said. Portuguese accent, soft but there.

"Morning," I said. He looked familiar from the hallway, always carrying a water bottle and a math textbook. Lucas. I only knew his name because someone else had asked him to watch their bag.

He looked at the stove. He looked at the dead plant. He sniffed. "Is it worse today?"

"It's early," I said. "Air is thick." I gestured at the tiles, the light, the way they made everyone look like a postcard. "Worth it, though."

He smiled politely, the kind of smile you give to people who are too tired to argue with. He filled his bottle and stepped aside, letting me have the space even though I was taking up more than my share.

Yuki turned the stove knob slightly and the flame grew. The pot began to whisper. Steam rose in slow, perfect tendrils. My eyes tracked it instinctively. Steam in morning light was content gold.

"Do you mind if I..." I pointed at her pot.

She shrugged. "Okay." Her permission was flat. I moved the ring light just enough to catch the steam in the edge of the frame. It made the tiles look soft, the way filters do. My phone recorded the steam, my hand, the cigarette, the cup. It looked like a quiet scene. It wasn't.

The hiss sharpened again, almost like it was offended at being ignored.

I felt a light pressure at my temples. A small headache blooming behind my eyes. I told myself it was the ring light. I told myself it was the lack of sleep. I told myself it was the kind of thing that happens when you wake up at 4:47 for a job that doesn't pay you.

I hit stop. I checked the clip. It was nice. It was not enough. The cigarette was still unlit.

"You smoke?" Lucas asked. He was leaning against the counter now, scrolling on his phone. He didn't look up.

"It's for the shot," I said. I said it like it meant something. Like that was a normal reason to have a cigarette at 5 AM in a kitchen that smelled like a leak.

He hummed. "The sign says no smoking." He didn't sound like he cared. He sounded like he had said it just to say he'd said it.

"I won't," I said. That was a lie. I could feel it sitting on my tongue.

Yuki's rice began to boil. The steam grew thicker. It softened the tiles, made the air look almost misty. The gas smell mixed with wet starch. It was a strange, sour sweetness.

I reached for the lighter again. I could almost see the shot. The cigarette tip glowing orange, the steam curling, the light on the tiles like watercolor. My thumb brushed the spark wheel.

A faint click. No spark yet. The lighter was just a prop until I made it more.

Lucas stepped closer to the stove and wrinkled his nose. "Are you sure this is safe?" he asked, this time looking at me. I could see the concern in his eyes, the kind of concern that feels like an accusation.

"It's fine," I said, too quickly. I smiled, the kind that people believe because it's easier. "Old pipes, old building. It has a vibe."

"Vibe," he repeated, like he was tasting the word. "My grandmother had a vibe too. She also had a gas explosion."

I laughed, but the sound was small. "You're kidding."

He shrugged. "Mostly." He looked at the stove again. "Just saying."

Yuki turned off the burner and lifted the pot. The hiss didn't change. It didn't care about the burner. It didn't care about anything.

My phone buzzed on the table. Another message. *BrandRep: Need ember. Please confirm you can deliver.*

I stared at the words until they blurred. My hand went to the lighter without me asking it to. I thought about my bank balance. I thought about my mother's voice. I thought about the way the light in this kitchen could make the cigarette glow like a tiny sunrise. I thought about the difference between a prop and a real thing.

I picked up the cigarette, rolled it between my fingers. The paper felt dry. The tobacco inside was a promise.

"Do you need help with your video?" Yuki asked, a sudden kindness. Her English was careful. Her eyes were on my tripod.

"No, it's fine," I said. "Just need the..." I waved the cigarette. "Flame."

She nodded, like the word meant something to her. She took her pot to the table, poured rice into a bowl, and sat on the bench to eat. The steam wrapped her hands. She looked small and quiet in the corner of my frame.

The hiss sharpened again. It was higher now, thinner, like a mosquito you can't kill. I turned slightly toward the stove. The back wall had a line of yellowing where the gas pipe ran. The connector behind the stove was hidden, but the sound was there, a small animal behind the tiles.

I wanted to pull the stove away, to look. I wanted to run. I wanted to finish the shot and be done.

"Maybe open the door," Lucas said. He was holding his water bottle, cap off, as if he might leave quickly. "Just for some air."

"It ruins the light," I said before I could stop myself. I heard it come out and hated it. I heard it and heard the worst version of myself in it, the one I was always trying to outrun.

Lucas blinked. He didn't say anything. He put his bottle cap on and stepped toward the door.

"Wait," I said, because the draft would ruin the shot, because the draft would make the lighter flicker, because everything was always about the shot. "Just... give me two minutes?"

He looked at me for a long moment, then he opened the door anyway. The air rushed in like a slap. The ring light flickered. The hiss dipped, then surged back like it had been insulted.

"Two minutes," he said, and left the door cracked. He leaned in the doorway, half in, half out, like a man who wanted to be polite but also wanted to breathe.

The draft made my hair move. It was almost cinematic. I could have used it. I didn't.

I adjusted the ring light back to steady. I adjusted myself. The gas smell thinned a little, enough that I could pretend it was gone. I could pretend the air was normal. That was all I needed.

I hit record again.

I lifted the cigarette, held it between my fingers, angled it toward the light. My hand looked elegant. My nails were perfect. My thumb rested on the lighter wheel. I could feel the texture, the ridges under my skin.

"This is my little Lisbon ritual," I said to the camera. My voice was soft, a little breathy. "You know, slow mornings, a cigarette, espresso, just me and the city."

The hiss underlined every word.

I brought the lighter closer to the cigarette and rolled the wheel with my thumb. The lighter clicked, but there was no spark. It had been damp in the courtyard. I flicked again. Nothing. I flicked a third time. A tiny spark jumped, died. The smell of butane joined the gas smell, a chemical note on top of an already chemical song.

"Come on," I whispered, more to the lighter than the camera.

The lighter clicked again. A spark danced and vanished. My thumb slipped, scraped the wheel. A sharp sting. I could feel the faint smell of my own skin, raw.

Behind me, Yuki's spoon clinked against her bowl. Lucas sighed in the doorway. The hiss didn't care. The ring light hummed. The morning light moved across the tiles, slowly sliding like a clock hand. I was losing the angle. I was losing the light. I was losing everything I could control.

I flicked again. This time the flame caught, a small blue flower blooming in my hand.

The air in the room felt like it held its breath.

I paused with the flame hovering an inch from the cigarette tip. The flame wavered in the draft from the door. It was beautiful, smaller and brighter than the ring light, a real light in a room of fake ones. The gas smell tightened around it like a secret.

"Sienna," Lucas said, and his voice was different. It was lower. He was not joking now. "Maybe not."

I looked at him. His face was pale in the morning light. His eyes were fixed on the flame, not on me. He wasn't worried about me. He was worried about the room.

"It's fine," I said, and smiled for the camera, not for him. I angled the cigarette, moved it toward the flame. "It's just a second."

The hiss behind the stove sharpened, like a breath drawn in.

I hesitated. Not because of Lucas. Not because of Yuki. Because of the light. The light was wrong now. The draft from the door was pulling it thin, making it look nervous. The flame didn't look cinematic. It looked scared. It would make me look scared too.

I pulled the cigarette back, blew out the flame, and cursed under my breath. The butane taste sat sharp on my tongue.

"You can't even smoke," Lucas muttered.

"I'm not smoking," I snapped. "I'm working."

He didn't answer. He just shook his head and stepped out into the hallway, leaving the door open wider. The air rushed in. The hiss softened. The light shifted. The perfect shot slid away.

Yuki finished her rice, picked up her bowl, and stood. She looked at me then, a small furrow between her brows. "You should open window," she said, like a simple instruction.

"It doesn't open," I said. My voice was smaller now.

She nodded. She didn't ask why it didn't open. She just walked out, her slippers quiet on the tile. The door swung a little more open as she passed. The room breathed, easier now.

---

I stood there with the lighter in my hand, my thumb still tingling from the scrape, and the urge to leave hit me so fast it felt like a shove. The hallway air looked thin and clean, like bottled water. I stepped out before I could talk myself back.

The hallway was dim and narrow, tiled with the same blue and white pattern that made the kitchen famous. In the softer light, the tiles looked tired, the grout dark, the paint chipped. The hostel smelled like lemon cleaner and wet towels and whatever perfume someone had sprayed in the dorm to hide a hangover. It smelled like real life, which was never the point.

Joana was coming up the stairs, keys clinking on her wrist. She was carrying a small toolbox with one broken latch clanging against the metal. Her face was drawn, not with sleep but with the kind of exhaustion that comes from having to pretend everything is fine all day.

She saw me and stopped. Her eyes went to the lighter, then the cigarette. She didn't need to see more.

"No," she said. It wasn't angry. It was tired.

"It's for a shoot," I said. I held up the ring light like it was a badge, like it could excuse me. "I'm not actually smoking."

She gave me a look that said she had heard every excuse in every language. "The gas doesn't care if you inhale," she said. "The spark is enough."

I glanced back toward the kitchen. The door was still open, just a crack. The hiss sounded different from out here, thinner, less urgent. It was easier to pretend it wasn't real.

"We're getting it checked," she said, as if reading my mind. "The owner says tomorrow. I told him today. He says tomorrow. It is always tomorrow."

"Tomorrow doesn't work for me," I said before I could stop myself.

She almost smiled. "It doesn't work for anyone."

We stood there for a second, the hallway humming with the old building's small noises. The pipes ticked somewhere overhead. The floorboards creaked as someone turned over in a bed on the second floor. In the distance, I heard the first tram of the morning clatter up the hill, that metal rattle like a chain being dragged across the city.

"You should leave the door open," Joana said. "At least until he calls someone. The air needs to move."

"It ruins the light," I said, and immediately hated how small that sounded in the hallway, in the real world.

She didn't scold me. She just looked at me, really looked. Her eyes were hazel and practical. "You are talented," she said. "You see things. But you do not see this."

I laughed, a short, defensive sound. "You don't know me."

"I know what it smells like when a building is about to hurt someone," she said. "And I know a girl who thinks she can bargain with it."

I held the lighter tighter. The saint sticker on it had curled at the edges. Maria's little prayer was peeling away, one corner lifting like it wanted out.

"I need to get this shot," I said, because it was all I had. "It's a paid post. If I don't deliver, I can't... I can't stay here. I can't stay anywhere."

Her expression softened. "There is work in Lisbon that is not photos," she said. "You could help at my aunt's cafe. She pays cash. She would feed you."

The word feed sat in my chest. The last time someone had offered to feed me was my mother, on the phone, her kettle clicking in the background like a heartbeat. I didn't want to think about it. I didn't want to think about home.

"I'm fine," I lied.

She sighed. "Fine is how accidents happen."

She shifted the toolbox in her hand and glanced past me into the kitchen. The ring light buzzed from inside like a trapped insect. The smell of gas was stronger now that the door had been open, like it had been waiting for a reason to be noticed.

"Don't close the door," she said again.

"I'll keep it cracked," I said. It was a compromise I didn't intend to keep.

She nodded, like she knew that too. "If you do it," she said quietly, "do it fast. And then leave the room. Air it. Promise me that."

I wanted to say yes. I wanted to promise her something that sounded like responsibility. I wanted to be the version of me that other people could trust. I couldn't afford that version right now.

"Okay," I said. The word was easy. The lie was not.

She touched my arm as she passed, a brief, almost maternal gesture, and then she went down the hall toward reception. The keys on her wrist jingled like a warning.

I stood alone in the hallway for a moment, breathing air that felt thin and safe and not mine. I could have walked out the front door. I could have called Rafa, caught a bus, eaten a pastel de nata somewhere that didn't smell like mercaptan. I could have answered my mother. I could have done a hundred things that would have felt like quitting.

Instead I turned back toward the kitchen.

I stood alone in the kitchen with my props and my ring light and the door cracked open like a mouth. The hiss was lower but still there. The gas smell was thinner, but still sweet and heavy if I paid attention. I didn't want to pay attention.

I closed the door.

The air changed weight again. It settled around my ankles, then my knees, then my chest. The hiss sharpened. The room felt smaller. The light in here was perfect again. The tiles looked like a dream.

I set the door latch so it wouldn't swing. I set my phone to record. I lined the cigarette up with the cup and the tiles. I checked my face in the preview. I made myself look like a person who had control.

This time I didn't rehearse. I didn't do the little fake inhale. I didn't say my little speech. I just reached for the lighter and put my thumb on the wheel.

My hand was steady now. The room was still. The hiss became a thin line of silence. The gas smell was so thick it felt like fabric against my lips.

I thought about the brand rep. I thought about my mother's voicemail. I thought about the lemon tree and Rafa's backpack disappearing around the corner. I thought about my bank balance and the way my face looked in the ring light, warm and alive and yes.

I rolled the wheel with my thumb.

The spark jumped once, sharp and bright.

The kitchen held its breath.
