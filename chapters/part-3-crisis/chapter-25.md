# Chapter 25: The Spark That Chooses

The spark jumped once, sharp and bright, and then nothing happened, which felt worse.

---

It was the kind of silence that follows a punch. The lighter had thrown its tiny flash into the air, the gas had not answered, and the room was still holding its breath like it was deciding whether to forgive me or punish me.

My thumb ached against the wheel. The smell of butane had briefly joined the gas, a chemical duet, and then faded, leaving the mercaptan thick and sweet again. The ring light hummed. The tiles looked like they were lit from inside. The warning notice was a rectangle of yellow in the corner of my frame, a confession I couldn't stop filming.

I realized I was holding my breath and let it go, slow. The air scraped my throat. The hiss behind the stove went on, steady and indifferent. It hadn't been a spark in a vacuum. It had been a spark in a room full of invisible danger, and the danger had chosen to wait.

"Do it now," I whispered to myself, because if I waited I would think, and if I thought I would leave.

My thumb rolled the wheel again.

The spark jumped, smaller this time, a weak little click of light that died before it became a flame. The lighter coughed. The saint sticker curled another millimeter at the edge. I shook the lighter once, like I could coax it into being a better version of itself.

The door creaked.

I froze. The draft slid across my ankles, a cooler ribbon of air. The ring light flickered. The hiss wavered and then resumed.

Joana stepped in, keys clinking on her wrist, her eyes already tired. She stopped when she saw me, when she saw the lighter in my hand, when she saw the closed door. Her face did not change much, which somehow made it worse.

"You closed it," she said.

"I need the light," Sienna said. Her voice sounded thin, even to her.

Joana's gaze moved from the lighter to the cigarette to the warning notice. She didn't raise her voice. She didn't have to. "The light is not worth your lungs," she said. "Or anyone else's."

"I'm not lighting it," Sienna lied, and then looked down at her thumb, which had been trying very hard to do exactly that.

Joana stepped closer and opened the door again with her shoulder. The air moved. The hiss dipped. The smell thinned by a hair. She didn't ask permission. She didn't ask for a promise. She just did it.

"Pedro says the gas man is coming tomorrow," Joana said, as if she was reading a weather report. "He says many things. Today, the air is sick. It wants to burn."

"It already did yesterday," Sienna said, and tried to make it a joke. It wasn't.

Joana watched her a moment. "You are not the only one in this building," she said softly. "You are not the only story." She glanced at the ring light, the phone, the carefully arranged cup. "Tell a different story." Then she turned and left, the keys on her wrist jingling like a curse.

Sienna stood there with the lighter in her hand and the door open and the air moving and the shot ruined. The draft made the flame look nervous, if she could even get a flame. It made the cigarette look less cinematic, the tiles less still. The image in her mind had shifted. The real world had pushed its way in.

She tried the lighter again. The wheel scraped her thumb. No spark.

She wanted to throw it. She wanted to go after Joana and ask for help, not with the gas, but with her life. She wanted to leave. She wanted to be the person who did the sensible thing.

Instead, she forced herself to try one more take, because she always did, because the part of her that wanted to be responsible was weaker than the part of her that wanted to be paid.

She left the door cracked open, despite the way it ruined the frame. The draft pushed her hair across her cheek. The tiles lost their stillness. The flame, if it came, would twitch and look nervous, but maybe nervous could be a vibe too. She pressed record and whispered a line about quiet mornings and old cities. She smiled into the ring light and felt the muscles in her face hold the shape like they always did.

She rolled the wheel. The lighter sparked. No flame. She tried again. A tiny flame caught and died. The gas smell slid up her throat like a cold hand. She held the lighter closer, as if closeness could make it obey. Her thumb stung. The ring light hummed louder, or maybe that was the hiss. It was hard to tell when everything in the room sounded the same.

The door opened a little wider and the draft killed the flame for her. A guest stepped in, yawning, hair sticking up in a soft fan. He paused when he saw the setup and raised his brows, the universal expression of people who don't know whether to be annoyed or impressed.

"Sorry," Sienna said, and pointed at the camera. "Just a quick shot."

He grunted and grabbed a mug, letting the cupboard bang shut louder than it needed to. The clatter made her flinch. The hiss continued, unbothered.

She tried again, the lighter finally catching, a blue flame standing upright in her hand. She held it near the cigarette, careful not to touch, careful not to spark the air in a way that would matter. The flame wavered in the draft. It looked fragile, a tiny animal about to bolt. She could see the shot in her head and the reality in front of her and they did not match.

"You smell that?" the guest asked, wrinkling his nose.

"Old pipes," she said automatically.

He snorted. "Everything in this place is old." He filled his mug and left without another word, letting the door swing wider behind him. The draft got stronger. The flame flickered and went out. The shot was dead.

She stopped recording and rubbed her face. The light on the tiles was already shifting. The morning was moving. The opportunity was slipping like water through her hands. The gas smell was thicker now, or maybe her patience was thinner.

She shut off the ring light and packed up her tripod with quick, jerky movements. The light dimmed, the tiles lost their glow, and the kitchen looked like what it was: a room with chipped grout and a sick plant and a dangerous leak behind an old stove. The hiss did not care that the lights had gone out.

She picked up her phone, turned off the recording, and stepped into the hallway. The air felt thinner, which was not the same as safe. She could still smell gas on her clothes. It was a new kind of perfume, one that did not wash out.

---

By midmorning, the hostel had rearranged itself around the idea that the kitchen was still a kitchen.

People moved through it with mugs, the way you move through a memory you have decided not to take seriously. The warning notice on the door had been ripped halfway down, its taped corners hanging loose. Someone had scribbled on it in pen: *no smoking* with a smiley face. Someone else had crossed out the smiley and drawn a skull.

Sienna sat in the courtyard with her laptop open, pretending to edit. The lemon tree shed a drip of water onto the screen. The air smelled like wet leaves, coffee, and, faintly, gas. It was impossible to tell if that last smell was real or if it had lodged itself in her brain like a song she couldn't stop humming.

Her phone buzzed on the table. The brand rep again. *How soon can you deliver?*

She stared at the message until the words softened. She typed back, *Tomorrow morning. Promise.* The word promise felt like a trap she was setting for herself.

Rafa had already gone. She had left a note on a napkin by Sienna's mug: *Come if you want. Don't if you don't. But don't die for a reel.* The handwriting was rushed. The message was not. Sienna folded the napkin and put it in her pocket, a talisman she didn't know if she would use.

Across the courtyard, Maria sat with her kettle, a cigarette in her fingers, her sainted lighter on her lap. She caught Sienna looking and lifted her chin toward the kitchen door.

"You go in there again," Maria said. It was not a question.

"I need one shot," Sienna said.

"You need lungs," Maria said.

Sienna laughed, but it sounded like a cough. "I need money," she said. "Those are the lungs now."

Maria took a slow drag and exhaled into the air like a blessing. "Money does not breathe you," she said. "Air does." She flicked ash into a cracked ceramic pot. "Also money does not like fire as much as you do."

Sienna looked down at her bank app. The numbers still glowed red. It was easier to believe in the numbers than in warnings.

A new group of guests trickled into the courtyard, dragging wheeled suitcases, their wheels clacking over the tiles. They were the bright kind of travelers, fresh and unwrinkled, asking about rooftop views. Joana smiled and pointed them toward the common room. Pedro stood behind her, hands clasped, nodding too much. He looked like a man holding his breath.

Sienna watched him for a while. She wondered if he smelled the gas, if he felt it in his lungs, if he saw the same invisible threat. She wondered if he told himself it was just old pipes. She wondered if he told himself anything other than that it would be fine.

She closed her laptop and went upstairs. The dorm was quiet, sheets rumpled, bodies asleep at odd angles. She found her linen shirt draped over the back of a chair, the one that always photographed well. She ran her fingers over the fabric, the way she sometimes touched her own arm when she needed to remember she was real.

She couldn't sit still. The courtyard felt too small and the dorm felt too honest. She went back downstairs and out onto the street, the morning already warming the stones. Lisbon smelled like coffee and diesel and bread. It smelled like a city that was busy with its own problems.

She walked down the hill to a tabacaria, the kind with a faded Coca-Cola sign and newspapers in the window. The clerk was an older man with a moustache and a pinking of skin at the cheeks. He looked up as she came in, his eyes quick and not unkind.

"Bom dia," he said.

"Um pacote," she said, holding up two fingers like she knew what she was doing. "Lights?"

He handed her a pack of cigarettes with the casual efficiency of someone who had done this a thousand times. The warning on the front showed black lungs like two bruised balloons. She stared at it for a second. The lungs looked like a photo filter gone wrong. She told herself it was about smoking, not about gas.

"Is there a lighter?" she asked.

He slid one across the counter, a cheap plastic one with a soccer logo she didn't recognize. She paid in coins that felt too heavy for their worth. As she turned to leave, she noticed a handwritten sign taped above the door: *Cheiro a gas? Feche a valvula e ligue 112.* The word gas was the only one she understood. The rest might as well have been poetry.

She stepped outside and tucked the pack into her bag. The lighter was cool in her hand, a new little weight. The street was bright, the kind of light that would make a good shot, but she didn't lift her phone. She didn't want to frame anything that wasn't the kitchen. The kitchen was the only place her plan could work.

On the walk back, she passed a cafe with its windows thrown open. The smell of espresso was strong and clean. A woman in a white apron wiped down a table, humming. The sound made Sienna ache in a place she couldn't photograph. She kept walking.

Her phone buzzed again. Another message. *If client doesn't like it, we can't pay. We need real flame, real ember. No edits.*

Real. Real. The word was a nail. She typed back, *Got it.*

Her reflection in the mirror looked tired. She had dark smudges under her eyes, a slight pallor she couldn't contour away. It would show in a reel. The light in the kitchen would fix it, she told herself. The light always fixed it.

She went down to the common room to fill a bottle. The gas smell was weaker there, diluted by furniture polish and stale beer. The record player in the corner spun a vinyl that crackled softly, the music a little too slow. A group of nomads were working at the table, their laptops open, their voices low. They talked about revenue streams and burnout, about how to monetize authenticity. Sienna smiled to herself, darkly. Everybody had the same problem, just dressed differently.

Dylan sat by the window, legs stretched, looking at the surf forecast on his phone. He glanced up when she passed. "Hey," he said.

"Hey," she replied.

He hesitated. "You still here?"

"Just for tonight," she said. It was a lie that was becoming a ritual.

He nodded toward the kitchen. "That smell is worse."

"It's probably just morning air," she said, though it wasn't morning anymore.

He watched her a moment. "You can surf with me tomorrow," he said. "I can get you a wetsuit. It's not aesthetic, but it's real."

She laughed, a little surprised at the softness of the offer. "I can't surf," she said.

"Neither can I," he said, deadpan. "We can still go."

She wanted to say yes, just to see what it felt like to do something that wasn't for the camera. But her phone buzzed in her pocket, and the moment disappeared like the last of a story you were about to post.

"Maybe next time," she said.

"You're running out of next times," he said, and then looked away, as if he'd said too much.

She pretended not to hear it.

---

By evening, the air in the hostel had become thick with bodies and noise and the smell of everyone else's dinner. The kitchen door was propped open with a mop bucket. The warning notice had been taped back up, crooked. The hiss from behind the stove was still there if you listened for it, the kind of sound that hides under louder things.

Sienna sat on the rooftop with a cheap beer in one hand and her phone in the other. The sun was setting over the Tagus, the river turning into a dull strip of metal. The city looked like a postcard, all terracotta and soft gold. She took a photo, filtered it, posted it with a caption about gratitude and light. It was the kind of thing her followers expected, and they rewarded her with a small rain of hearts.

Her phone buzzed with a comment. *Obsessed.* Another. *Queen.* A DM. *Where is your linen set from?*

She answered the DM and avoided the other messages, the ones from her father and her mother. She could feel the unopened voicemail sitting in her phone like a stone. She told herself she would listen to it later. Later was always easier.

A couple nearby were arguing quietly about a missed train. Another group laughed too loudly at a joke that wasn't funny. Someone played a guitar badly. The string lights over their heads flickered with the wind, making the air feel briefly stroboscopic. It felt like a warning. It also felt like good content. Sienna hated that she could not tell the difference anymore.

Her phone buzzed again. *BrandRep:* Client wants to see a rough cut by tomorrow noon. Needs flame. Needs ember. Needs it to look effortless.

Effortless was not what she felt. Effortless was a lie she made look pretty. She stared at the message until the screen dimmed. When it did, her reflection appeared in the black glass, a faint ghost of her face looking back.

She went downstairs early, before the rooftop started to feel like a party and less like a place to hide. The stairwell smelled like damp plaster. She could hear the kitchen from the landing, the clink of dishes, the old refrigerator humming. Beneath it all, the hiss was faint but steady, a thin thread of sound. It threaded its way into her chest.

The kitchen was busier now, the golden hour crowd filtering in for water and wine and those complicated midnight snacks that made everyone laugh too loudly. Someone had put on a playlist of soft fado that sounded like it was playing from the bottom of a well. The open window at the end of the hallway was still painted shut. The door was propped open with the mop bucket again, and the warning notice hung at a sad angle.

Sienna stepped inside, mostly to prove she could. The air smelled like garlic and detergent and the faint sweetness of gas. A couple of guys were chopping tomatoes at the table, their laughter bouncing off the tiles. Yuki sat near the door with a cup of tea, her shoulders hunched, eyes on her phone. Lucas was at the sink again, filling his bottle like it was a ritual. He glanced at Sienna and then away, the way you look at someone whose car is idling in a closed garage.

She set her phone on the table and opened her camera, pretending she was just checking the light. The tiles were still beautiful. The light was still cruel. The hiss came through the song like a word she couldn't unhear.

"Hey," Lucas said, quietly. "You okay?"

"Yeah," she said. "Just looking."

"At the tiles?" he asked. He tried to smile. It didn't stick.

"At the light," she said. It was easier than explaining the rest.

One of the guys at the table flicked a lighter to light a candle in a little glass jar. The flame popped up, small and controlled, and the entire room seemed to lean toward it. Sienna felt her stomach drop. The candle flame waved gently, the way flames do when they're bored. Nothing exploded. Everyone went on talking.

The man laughed at a joke and blew out the candle with a quick puff. Sienna's breath caught anyway, as if the room had just exhaled after holding it for too long.

She could have done it then, she thought. She could have lit her cigarette and been just one more flame in a room full of them. She could have told herself it was normal because someone else had done it first. The thought was a little sickening and a little tempting. Her life had become a series of permissions she didn't remember granting.

Yuki looked up from her phone. "It smells more tonight," she said, not to anyone in particular. "Like eggs."

Lucas nodded. "It is worse."

"Maybe because the door is open and it pulls it out," one of the guys said. He waved his knife toward the open doorway as if air could be controlled by opinion.

"Maybe because it's a gas leak," Yuki said. Her tone was flat. She took a sip of tea and winced at the heat.

The guy shrugged. "It's Lisbon. Buildings are old."

"My aunt's building is old," Lucas said. "It does not smell like this." He capped his bottle. "If it did, she would run."

Sienna stood there with her phone in her hand and her new lighter in her pocket, and she realized no one in the room was actually disagreeing. They were just tired. They were just choosing not to act.

Pedro appeared in the doorway, drawn by the low hum of concern. He leaned against the frame, smiling too brightly. "Everything fine?" he asked.

"Smells stronger," Lucas said. His voice was calm. "Maybe we should shut it off again?"

Pedro's smile tightened, a seam pulling. "We cannot. People need to cook. People need hot water. If we close, we lose bookings. You understand, yes?" He said it like a plea, like a question, like a statement.

"People also need to breathe," Yuki said.

Pedro laughed, a short, deflecting sound. "Of course. We are not dying. We are fine." He glanced at Sienna and then away. He did not want to be seen by the person who was most likely to turn this into content.

Joana stepped in behind him, hands in her hoodie pockets. She looked at the gas stove, at the open door, at the faces. "The company said tomorrow," she said, her Portuguese flattening the words. "They always say tomorrow." She looked at Sienna. "Don't make tomorrow worse."

Sienna nodded and put her phone away. She wanted to say she wasn't the only one making it worse. She wanted to say the leak was not her fault. She wanted to say she was just doing a job. The words felt thin in her mouth.

She left the kitchen with her hands empty, the hiss still following her into the hallway.

In the dorm, she laid out her linen shirt again, her cigarette, her ring light. She set the alarm for 4:47. Then she set another for 4:50, and a third for 4:55. She sat on her bed and stared at the wall. The dorm was full of soft breathing and the occasional laugh from the hallway.

She tried to sleep. She scrolled instead.

Somewhere in the night, the power flickered. The fan in the corner stuttered. The phone screen dimmed and then brightened. The hostel groaned. She sat up in the dark, heart fast, listening. The hiss in the walls sounded closer, sharper. It was not a dream. It was the building whispering.

She thought about getting up, about walking down to reception and telling Joana, about waking people, about being the person who saved them. She thought about the look on her mother's face if she called and said, I almost died in a Lisbon hostel for a cigarette shot.

Then she thought about the brand rep's message, the red numbers in her bank app, the way the light hit the tiles at dawn. She thought about the caption she could write: *POV: you found your slow morning in Lisbon.* She thought about the comments. She thought about the tiny rush she always felt when the flame caught.

She lay back down.

Morning came without asking her permission. The alarm went off at 4:47, a soft chime in the dark. She sat up and swung her legs out of the bunk. Her feet found cold tile. The air was cool and a little wet, the kind of chill that makes you feel awake whether you want to be or not.

She pulled on the linen shirt, grabbed the ring light case, the cigarette, Maria's lighter. The saint sticker had peeled almost all the way off now, a little strip of plastic hanging loose. She pressed it down with her thumb. It did not stick.

She walked down the hallway toward the kitchen. The lights were off. The hostel was a sleeping animal. The hiss from behind the stove seemed louder at night, or maybe she was just paying attention.

She stopped outside the kitchen door, her hand on the knob. The warning notice hung crooked in the dark. Someone had drawn a heart around the words NO SMOKING, as if it were a joke.

She pushed the door open.

The kitchen breathed in. The smell of gas was heavier than ever, thick and sweet, a syrup in the air. Her eyes watered. Her throat tightened. She stepped inside anyway, because she had made a promise to a brand rep and to herself, and those promises felt louder than anything the air could say.

She set up the ring light. The tiles bloomed blue and white. The espresso cup looked like a prop on a stage. The cigarette was pale and perfect, waiting.

She set her phone to record. The red dot blinked. She lifted the lighter and put her thumb on the wheel. The metal was cold. Her thumb was steady.

She rolled the wheel once.

The spark jumped, bright and clean.

The kitchen held its breath.
