# Chapter 26: The Breath That Lies

The spark died so fast it felt like it had never been there, and the room pretended it hadn't been waiting for it.

---

Sienna blinked, thumb still pressed to the wheel, the lighter still open in her hand. The ring light held its white circle. The tiles held their blue breath. The hiss behind the stove did not change, as if the gas itself had exhaled and decided to keep the secret.

For a moment she wanted to laugh. This was what she had risked the entire morning for? A flicker and nothing? Her skin felt damp with the kind of sweat that isn't heat but fear. The air tasted like pennies left in a warm mouth. She could feel the gas on her tongue, an oily sweetness that did not belong in a kitchen.

She rolled the wheel again. The spark jumped, brighter this time, and caught. A small blue flame held steady on the lighter's tip. It was beautiful in a cheap, honest way. It was the only real light in a room designed for photos.

Her hand hovered. The cigarette rested on the saucer, pale and smooth, waiting to be made into content. The flame wavered slightly, as if it could feel the weight of the room.

She brought the cigarette closer. One second, she told herself. Just an ember, just a little glow. The brand rep's message pulsed in her mind like a second heartbeat.

A thin pop sounded from behind the stove, a soft tick of metal expanding and contracting. The kind of sound old buildings make when they are awake. It could have been a pipe. It could have been nothing. In her body, it felt like a warning.

Sienna froze with the flame an inch from the cigarette. The hiss behind the stove sharpened, like a breath drawn in. The air seemed to press against her knuckles.

She blew out the lighter.

The flame vanished, and the room exhaled. She stood there with the dead lighter in her hand, her lungs full of gas she did not want. She hadn't even lit the cigarette, and already the shot was ruined. The ember never came. The light had moved. The morning was sliding away, and with it her chance to deliver the thing she promised in a text.

She set the lighter down and pressed her fingers into her temples. A headache bloomed, a soft pressure behind her eyes. She didn't know if it was the gas or the stress. She didn't want to know.

Sienna opened the kitchen door and stood in the crack of it, letting the hallway air push the heavy smell out. The draft made the ring light flicker and the tiles lose their perfect flatness. She let it. She needed to breathe.

The hallway was quiet. Somewhere upstairs a cough. Somewhere down the street a tram rattled on its tracks, a thin chain of metal noise that reminded her the city kept moving even if she did not.

She shut off the ring light. The kitchen went dim, just morning glow and the shadow of the stove. Without the light, the room looked older and smaller, a place people cooked in, not a set. The dead plant on the sill looked like a blackened hand.

She grabbed her phone and the cigarette and the lighter and stepped out. The air in the hallway felt thin, like she had been underwater and surfaced too fast. She could still taste the gas, as if it had nested in her sinuses.

Joana appeared at the end of the corridor with a roll of paper towels under her arm. She stopped when she saw Sienna, her eyes going to the ring light case and then to Sienna's face.

"Did you do it?" Joana asked.

Sienna shook her head. "No flame. Not yet. The lighter is being dramatic." She forced a laugh. It came out thin.

Joana's mouth twisted, not quite a smile. "Dramatic is easy. Dangerous is harder." She tipped her head toward the kitchen. "Door. Leave it open." Her voice was firm now.

"It's open," Sienna said, and for once it wasn't a lie.

Joana looked at her a moment. "You feel dizzy?" she asked.

Sienna rubbed her temple. "Just tired. I got up early." She meant for it to sound light. It came out apologetic.

"Sleep in, then," Joana said. "The light will still be there. The building might not." She walked past, paper towels pressed to her chest like a shield.

Sienna watched her go. Joana's keys jingled as she turned the corner, the sound disappearing down the hall like a warning pulled away.

Sienna slid down the wall and sat on the cool tile for a moment. The hallway smelled like lemon cleaner and wet towels and someone else's shampoo. The kitchen smell clung to her hair and clothes. It felt like she was wearing it.

Her phone buzzed. She looked without wanting to.

*BrandRep:* Check-in. We need that ember shot. Deliver by noon tomorrow.

Noon tomorrow. Twenty-six hours. A countdown she hadn't asked for.

She typed back, *Working on it. Getting the perfect light.*

Perfect light was her currency. It was the only thing she had to sell. It was also the thing that kept sending her back into a room that wanted to burn.

She stood, dusted off her shorts, and carried her gear outside to the courtyard. The lemon tree was dripping after a night of fog, its leaves wet and glossy. The air out here smelled like citrus and earth and coffee from the street, clean in a way that felt almost rude.

She detoured into the bathroom first, the tiny tiled room with a mirror that always made her face look too wide. She washed her hands with the hostel's watery soap, rubbing until the skin around her thumb burned. The gas smell clung anyway, threaded into her hair and the collar of her linen shirt. She splashed water on her face and watched it bead on her cheekbones like a bad highlighter. For a second she caught her own eyes in the mirror and they looked like someone else's, someone who didn't have a plan and didn't know what to do with that fact. She pulled out her phone, considered filming the reflection as a moody story, and then shoved it back into her pocket. There were moments you didn't post because you didn't want them to be real.

She sat on the bench with her laptop and tried to edit the clips she did have. They were nice. They were almost. The tiles looked beautiful, the steam from yesterday's coffee in one shot, the cigarette still unlit. Almost doesn't pay, she thought. Almost doesn't get posted. Almost doesn't keep you traveling when your cards are maxed and your mother is leaving voicemails you don't open.

Maria shuffled out with her kettle and her plastic cup. She nodded at Sienna, then glanced at the kitchen door.

"You go in again?" Maria asked.

"Not yet." Sienna tried to sound casual, as if she had the luxury of waiting.

Maria set the kettle on the table. "The air is angry today." She said it like it was a person, not a leak. In Maria's world, everything had a soul, including bad pipes.

"It's always angry," Sienna said. She opened a file on her laptop and pretended to color-correct. The footage looked worse in daylight, all the cracks and chipped grout more visible.

Maria poured hot water into her cup. The steam curled up, soft and slow. "When it is angry, you do not poke it. You leave it to cool." She took a sip, and then she looked at Sienna's lighter. The saint sticker was peeled half off now, flapping like a small, reluctant flag. "Maybe you need a different saint," she said.

"Maybe I need a different job," Sienna said, and then regretted it.

Maria's eyes softened. "No. You need a job that keeps you breathing." She glanced toward the kitchen again, the way people glance toward a cracked tooth they can't stop worrying.

Sienna closed her laptop and stared at her hands. The nails were still perfect. The skin around her thumb was raw from the lighter wheel. She wondered if there was a photo filter for that.

Across the courtyard, the front door opened and a new group of guests dragged luggage through. Their suitcases clicked on the tiles like small hammers. They smiled too much, the way people do when they're about to become a version of themselves on vacation. Sienna watched them and felt a quick, mean envy. They didn't know yet. They still thought Lisbon was just light and tiles and good coffee.

Pedro stepped out to greet them, his smile too bright, his eyes already tired. He walked them through the common room, pointing at the couch, the guitar, the wall of postcards. He gestured toward the kitchen, his hand hovering just shy of the door as if he didn't want to touch it.

Sienna stood and followed him inside, not to join but to eavesdrop. The reception area was a narrow hall with a bell on the desk and a stack of clipboards. Joana sat behind the desk, her handwriting neat as she checked passports. She looked up when Sienna appeared and then looked away quickly, a silent warning.

Pedro's voice carried. "Kitchen is open. Breakfast is self-serve. No smoking inside." He delivered the last part with the smooth ease of someone who has said it a thousand times and never meant it.

One of the new guests, a boy with a man bun and a camera that looked more expensive than his backpack, asked about the tiles. Pedro brightened. "Original, nineteenth century," he said. "Very Instagram, yes?"

Sienna watched him work the room. Pedro was an influencer, too. His platform just happened to be a building.

After the check-in, Pedro pulled Joana aside. Sienna couldn't help listening, the way you listen when you know something is about to be said that will change a room.

"The gas man called," Pedro said quietly.

Joana's eyes lifted. "Today?"

Pedro shook his head. "Tomorrow. He says he's busy. It's always busy. We can't close the kitchen until then. We have bookings. We have reviews. You understand."

Joana's jaw tightened. "I understand people dying," she said, lower now. "I understand you won't pay for new pipes." She looked toward the kitchen with a quick, involuntary glance. "It is not just a smell now." Her voice thinned. "It is a sound." She lowered her head. "And it is your building."

Pedro's smile stiffened. "Don't scare guests." His tone was soft, but it had an edge. "We are a business. If we lose bookings, we close. Then everyone goes home. Do you want that?"

Joana's hands clenched around a clipboard. "I want to go home alive," she said.

Pedro rubbed his forehead. He looked old for a moment, and then he snapped back into his host persona. "I'll call him again," he said. "Maybe he comes early. Maybe he does not. But we cannot panic."

Sienna stepped back before they could see her. She felt like she'd swallowed a pebble. The hallway seemed narrower now, the air heavier even here. The smell of gas was faint in the reception area, like an echo.

She went back to the courtyard and sat on the bench again. Her phone buzzed with a new comment. *Queen of Lisbon.* She stared at it until it became meaningless. She wanted to be the queen of a city, not a corpse in its kitchen.

The sun climbed. The courtyard warmed. The lemon leaves let go of their last droplets. Sienna forced herself to edit. She clipped the best angles, added soft music, laid text over the footage that said things she didn't feel: *Slow mornings. Slow heart.* She saved the draft to post later, because she knew it wasn't the one that would pay her.

Her head still ached. Her throat felt sore. She told herself it was from talking, from sleeping wrong, from the air. It was always easier to blame the air than to blame the choices.

By noon, the kitchen had filled and emptied twice. It never stayed quiet. People clattered dishes, brewed coffee, argued about who bought the bread. The hiss beneath it all remained, steady and thin, a line of danger no one wanted to hear.

Sienna went inside once, just to fill her water bottle. The smell hit her immediately, heavier now in the heat. It felt like stepping into a room where someone had sprayed perfume to hide something worse. She filled her bottle fast and left. The water tasted faintly of metal.

She didn't go back in after that.

---

The afternoon fell into the kind of light she couldn't use. It was too harsh, too honest. She wandered the city instead, half working, half running. Lisbon was full of color, but the gas smell followed her in phantom threads. She walked past a bakery and felt her stomach turn, not from the smell of bread but from the way her mind kept insisting it was gas.

She sat on a hillside viewpoint and watched the yellow trams rattle by. Tourists took photos of each other, arms outstretched, faces bright. She lifted her phone and took a story of the view, tagged the location, added a caption she didn't mean: *Lisbon heals.*

A DM from her mother sat unopened. It had been there for days. She thumbed the message and then closed the app. She didn't want the sound of home to interrupt the sound of her own life. She was afraid if she opened it, she would lose the thread of who she was supposed to be.

She found a small kiosk and bought a coffee she didn't drink. She sat on a bench and watched people pass, trying to match their pace, their ease. It didn't fit. Her body was still tuned to the kitchen, to the ring light, to the pressure of a deadline. She could feel the lighter in her bag like a tiny pulse.

By late afternoon, she was back at Casa dos Azulejos because she didn't have anywhere else to be. The hostel smelled like bodies and cheap wine and damp towels. The kitchen door was propped open with the mop bucket again. The warning sign had been taped back up, crooked. Someone had drawn a tiny crown over the words NO SMOKING. Sienna almost laughed.

Dylan was in the common room, feet up on a chair, scrolling through surf conditions again. He looked up when she came in. "You alive?" he asked.

"Barely," she said. She tried to make it a joke.

He looked at her, then at the kitchen door. "It's worse," he said. "The smell. Like... it burns the back of your nose." He rubbed his nostrils as if to prove it.

"It's been worse for days," she said. She leaned against the doorframe, letting the cleaner air of the common room protect her. "They keep saying the gas man will come." She heard the cynicism in her own voice and didn't know if it was new.

Dylan tilted his head. "You going to use it tonight?" he asked.

"Use what?"

He glanced at her bag. "Your lighter. Your shot. Whatever."

Sienna shrugged. "Maybe tomorrow morning. The light is better." She could feel herself rationalizing even as she said it, like a reflex.

He nodded slowly. "If you want to surf, still," he said. "Tomorrow morning. Early. You can shoot stuff there too. It's light and water and the kind of thing you can breathe in."

She smiled at him, almost soft. "I'm not built for waves," she said.

"You're not built for gas either," he said. He said it like it was obvious.

She looked away. "Everything is content if you frame it right," she said.

"Yeah," he said. "That's the problem." He turned back to his phone, as if he didn't want to have to watch her make the choice. That was his kindness.

Sienna went upstairs to the dorm. It was bright, everyone gone for the afternoon. The beds were stripped, blankets piled in the center like the shed skins of sleep. She lay down and stared at the ceiling. The plaster had a hairline crack that ran above her bunk. It reminded her of a piece of string that could be pulled if you found the right end.

Her phone buzzed again. The brand rep. Always the brand rep.

*Need to see the ember. Client doesn't approve staged smoke. It must be real.*

She typed back, *Got it. Tomorrow morning. I'll send by noon.* She added a sparkle emoji. It felt like spitting.

She closed her eyes. She could still smell gas in her hair. She wondered if she imagined it, or if it had soaked into her skin. She could still hear the hiss, faint like tinnitus, like something only she could hear now. Maybe it wasn't there. Maybe it was in her head. Either way, it was there.

She fell asleep in her clothes, dreamless and shallow. When she woke, the room was turning blue with evening. She felt groggy, as if she had been underwater.

She sat up and listened. The hostel hummed. The faint wheeze of the old building. The distant clink of dishes. The sound of a door swinging in the hallway, then the soft thud of it closing. She heard the hiss again, or thought she did. She couldn't tell anymore.

She stood and went to the bathroom, splashed water on her face, and stared at herself in the mirror. Her eyes were slightly bloodshot. The corners of her mouth looked tired. She took a selfie anyway, cropped out the sinks, filtered it. She posted it with a caption about golden hour that was not true. The likes came in anyway. The algorithm did not care about truth.

When she went back downstairs, the common room was full. The fado playlist was on again, the sad voices curling around laughter. People were cooking in the kitchen, chopping vegetables, clattering pans, letting the kitchen do its job despite everything. The mop bucket still held the door open. The warning sign still sagged.

Sienna leaned in the doorway and watched. The air smelled of garlic and onions and gas. The smell of gas moved under everything, an undercurrent you could ignore if you tried. She did, because she had to. She could not be the person who stopped the world for a smell.

She went out to the courtyard with her notebook and sat under the lemon tree. She wrote potential captions for the next day's reel, each one empty. She deleted them and wrote new ones. She wrote, *POV: you finally found your morning.* She wrote, *Soft mornings, hard lessons.* She wrote, *The air tastes like Lisbon.* She erased that last one because it felt too close to the truth.

Joana came out to smoke. She leaned against the wall, cigarette between her fingers, eyes closed. She did not offer Sienna one. She just breathed.

"He didn't come," Joana said after a moment, as if continuing a conversation. "The gas man. He says tomorrow still."

Sienna nodded. "He always says tomorrow." Her voice was flat. It surprised her.

Joana opened her eyes. "If you need to leave, I can get you a bed in another hostel," she said. "My cousin has one in Estrela. It is not pretty, but it is safe."

Sienna laughed. It came out sharp. "Safe doesn't pay me," she said, and instantly hated herself for it.

Joana looked at her. "Pay yourself," she said. "Pay yourself by staying alive."

Sienna looked at her hands. The lighter sat in her palm like a small heart. The saint sticker was hanging by a thread.

"I'm not suicidal," Sienna said. She meant it.

"Neither am I," Joana said. "But the building doesn't ask." She flicked ash into the cracked pot and went back inside.

Sienna sat alone in the courtyard. The lemon tree smelled clean. The air was cool. She could have stayed there all night. She should have.

Instead, she went upstairs and set out her props again.

---

The night was slow and loud at the same time, a hostel trick. People came back from bars, laughing too hard, the smell of beer and sweat and the faint chemical edge of gas mixing in the hallway. Sienna lay in her bunk with earplugs in, the ring light case at her feet like a promise.

She set three alarms again. 4:47. 4:50. 4:55. She wanted a redundancy of waking, as if waking would keep her safe.

She dreamed of light. In the dream, she was holding the ring light over the kitchen table and the tiles were glowing from inside, each one a tiny sun. The gas smell was sweet like perfume. She lifted the lighter and the flame grew bigger than her hand, a soft, friendly fire. She leaned in and it kissed her forehead like a blessing.

She woke to the first alarm, heart already fast.

The dorm was dark and still. She could hear someone breathing above her, slow and steady. The air was cool, damp on her skin. She swung her legs down and the tile floor was cold enough to make her gasp.

She dressed in the linen shirt, grabbed the ring light, the cigarette, the lighter. The saint sticker finally peeled off and fell to the floor. She looked at it, a small rectangle of plastic with a faded face. She considered picking it up. She did not.

She walked down the hallway. The hostel was a sleeping animal, the kind that twitches in its sleep. The hiss from the kitchen seemed louder now, or maybe it was just that everything else was quiet.

She paused outside the kitchen door. The warning sign hung there, the heart around NO SMOKING still visible in the dark. She touched the paper with her fingertips. It was damp, soft. She left a faint fingerprint of moisture.

She pushed the door open.

The smell hit her like a hand. It was stronger than the morning before, a thick, sweet stench that made her eyes water. It felt like the air in a locked garage. It felt like breathing a secret.

She stepped inside anyway, because she had already promised, because the light was in the room, because the camera was her excuse for everything she didn't want to admit.

She set up the ring light, the circle of white cutting into the dark. The tiles bloomed. The table looked staged. The cigarette waited. The lighter sat in her palm, heavier without the saint.

She set the phone to record. The red dot blinked.

Her thumb found the lighter wheel.

The hiss behind the stove sounded like someone whispering her name.

She rolled the wheel and waited for the spark.
