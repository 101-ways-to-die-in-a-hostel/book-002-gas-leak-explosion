# Chapter 22: The Door That Breathes

The lighter in my hand felt like a borrowed heartbeat, warm and busy and not mine.

---

Maria's saint sticker stared up at me as I walked back into the kitchen, all chipped smile and peeling blessing. The lighter was old and scuffed, the kind of plastic that had passed through a hundred hands, the kind that remembered every cigarette it had ever fed. I held it too tight and it dug crescent moons into my palm.

The kitchen door was half open, breathing in slow pulls as people passed. Every time someone stepped through, the air tugged and the warning notice fluttered like a trapped moth. I told myself the movement meant safety, that a draft was better than stillness. The room smelled like toast and cleaning product and coffee, but the gas was there, thick as a secret. It clung to the tiles. It pooled at ankle level. It filled the quiet gaps between voices.

I slipped inside, and the room accepted me like a slow mouth.

Yuki was at the stove, standing on the balls of her feet to reach the front burner. She wore a hoodie with a small embroidered cat, her hair in a low ponytail, a practical air that was both soothing and irritating. A pot of rice steamed in front of her. The blue flame under it flickered like a nervous eye.

Lucas was by the sink, filling a bottle. He hummed along to the soft jazz track playing from someone's speaker. His humming was off-key, but it made the room feel normal. Normal is a drug. I watched him splash his face with water and shake droplets into his curls.

Dylan leaned against the table, scrolling. He lifted his head when he saw me. "You're back," he said, like I'd returned to a crime scene.

"I'm just grabbing my shot," I said, and the words sounded rehearsed because they were.

"You're not even hungry." He tried to smile. It didn't land.

"Content is hungry," I said, and forced a laugh. He didn't.

The hiss was audible now, a thin, steady whistle from behind the stove. It stitched itself into the music. It made my teeth vibrate. If I focused, I could hear it even over the kettle in the courtyard, even over the clatter of plates.

I set my ring light stand by the table, then hesitated. The door was open. If I left it that way, the light wouldn't be perfect, but the air would at least move. It was a trade. Everything was a trade.

I forced myself to smile at Yuki. "Hey, could you maybe..." I gestured vaguely at the stove.

She looked over her shoulder. "Sorry, you need the stove?"

"No, no," I said. "Just, um, I need the table for like two minutes. It's for..." I waved my phone like it explained everything.

Her eyes flicked to the ring light, the tiles, the cigarette in my other hand. She frowned slightly. "You can use the other end."

The other end was near the door, where the light was uneven and the warning notice would glare in the shot like a scolding parent. The perfect frame was at the center, right under the tiles. The perfect frame was right where the gas liked to sleep.

"Two minutes," I said. "Promise."

Lucas glanced at me and then at the warning notice. "Are you gonna light that?" he asked.

"No," I said. "It's just a prop."

A lie so familiar it barely counted.

He shrugged and turned back to the sink. Yuki stirred her rice with a wooden spoon, the pot rattling softly. The flame under it flickered again, and I felt the room tighten.

I set my phone on the table, angled it until the tile pattern framed my face, the cup, the cigarette, the lighter. I switched on the ring light. The kitchen shifted. The tiles turned a brighter blue, my skin smoothed, my eyes sharpened into the version that sold. The warning notice in the background became a textural element, a little splash of yellow that made the frame more interesting. It looked less like a warning and more like a prop.

"You're actually gonna use the sign?" Dylan asked.

"It's a vibe," I said. I was only half joking.

He shook his head. "This place is cursed."

"All hostels are cursed," I said.

I started recording. "Morning, guys," I said softly, that fake sleepy voice that sounded more fragile than I felt. "We're doing a little slow-living moment. We are in Lisbon, and the light in this kitchen is, like, a crime." I tilted the cigarette toward the camera, held the lighter near it, paused.

I didn't flick it. Not yet.

The air tasted like pennies again, like licking a key. I kept smiling. I kept talking. I kept the world framed where I wanted it.

Behind me, someone laughed. The door breathed. The hiss continued.

My phone buzzed with a text from the brand rep. *Need flame. Client wants authenticity.*

Authenticity. That's what they always asked for, and it never meant anything. It meant the kind of lie that looked real. It meant me doing something stupid on camera so they could sell it back to my followers as effortless.

I stopped recording, jaw tight.

"Just once," I whispered to myself. "Just this." I wasn't sure if I meant the flame or the whole life.

Yuki poured her rice into a bowl and carried it to the table, the steam rising in clean white. She sat down and began eating, eyes on her phone. The smell of rice cut through the gas for a moment, soft and sweet.

Lucas tightened his bottle cap and leaned against the counter, eyes half closed, savoring the coolness of the water. He seemed to notice the air for the first time, his nostrils flaring. He made a face, then shrugged.

"You smell it, yeah?" Dylan said, low.

Lucas nodded. "Smells like..." He searched for the word. "Like an egg fart."

"It's the drains," I said automatically, the lie part of the scenery. "It's a Lisbon thing."

Dylan stared at me. He had the kind of eyes that made it easy to feel seen, even when you were pretending. "It's gas," he said.

"I know," I said, and my voice went flatter than I wanted.

He opened his mouth, closed it, looked at Yuki, then at the stove. "We should probably not..."

"It's fine," I said quickly. "Pedro said he fixed it."

The hiss sharpened in the silence that followed. Pedro had said nothing of the kind. But Pedro was easy to imagine saying it. Pedro said what people needed to hear.

The blue flame jumped. Yuki glanced up, eyes narrowing. "It keeps doing that," she said.

"The burner?" Lucas asked.

"The flame." She made a little motion with her fingers, fluttering.

"That's normal," I said. It wasn't.

Pedro pushed through the door, a tray of clean mugs in his hands. He looked like a man who had decided to smile his way through catastrophe. "Good morning, everyone!" he said. "Coffee is back. Showers are back. We are good, yes?"

No one answered. He kept smiling anyway.

"Pedro," Dylan said, "the gas smell is stronger."

"Old building," Pedro said with a shrug. "It always smells like something. The pipes are old. The city is old." He set the mugs down and spread his hands. "We are fine." He made eye contact with me, and his smile flickered. "No smoking, yes?"

"Of course," I said, and felt the lighter in my palm burn.

Pedro's smile hardened. "Good. We do not want any accidents." He laughed, a little too loudly, then left the room with the same bright energy, as if he could carry the problem out with him.

The door swung shut behind him, and for a second the room held its breath. Then someone else pushed it open, and it exhaled again. The notice fluttered. The hiss continued.

I looked at my phone. Another message. *If you can't get flame, we can't pay. Deadline in 20.*

Twenty minutes. My whole month in a number.

I took a slow breath, tasted metal. The gas was everywhere now. I could feel it in the back of my throat, in the tiny ache behind my eyes. My fingers were colder than they should have been. The lighter felt heavier.

"Give me five," I said to no one.

"What?" Lucas asked.

"Nothing." I leaned in close to my phone, lowered my voice. "Guys, this is everything," I murmured to the camera, eyes half-lidded, a smile like a secret. "European mornings just hit different." I lifted the cigarette toward the lens, tilted the lighter.

My thumb hovered. I felt my heartbeat in it.

The flame on the stove flickered again, higher this time, a sudden lick of blue that made Yuki flinch. A tiny pop. A breath. The hiss doubled, as if the room itself was warning me.

Dylan reached for my wrist. "Sienna."

"Not now," I whispered.

He didn't let go. His fingers were warm, grounded. It felt like a lifeline. It felt like an obstacle. I pulled back.

"Just a second," I said.

Yuki stood up, bowl in hand. "I'm taking this outside," she said. "The air is weird." She nodded at the courtyard as if to herself.

Lucas followed her with his eyes. "I should go, too," he said.

"It's not that bad," I said. "You can sit by the door." My voice cracked on the last word. I could hear how desperate I sounded.

Lucas shrugged and left anyway, bottle in hand. Dylan hesitated, eyes on me, then shook his head and walked after them.

The room thinned. The air grew quieter. The hiss grew louder.

I stood alone with the stove flame, the ring light, the tiles, and the lighter in my hand. The warning notice stared at me from the door like a teacher waiting for a confession.

The camera was still recording. The red dot blinked. The clock on the screen ticked.

I told myself I had exactly ten seconds. I told myself if I didn't take them now, I'd lose everything. I told myself I could fix anything.

Then someone pushed the door open, and the kitchen filled with noise again.

---

I fled to the corridor like a thief who'd been caught in her own house.

The hallway was cooler, the air cleaner. I leaned against the wall and let my head thud softly into the plaster. The gas smell lingered on my hoodie and in my hair. It was a perfume I hadn't chosen.

My phone buzzed again. *Client says no flame, no payment. Sorry.*

The message was a punch. It didn't hurt the way real pain does. It was quieter than that. It was the kind of hurt that sits at the bottom of your stomach and makes it feel hollow.

I opened my bank app. The numbers glowed red. The overdraft line looked like a dead pulse. My rent back home, my flight back, my credit card interest, my pride. All of it sat in those little digits, asking for a miracle.

The lighter warmed my palm. Maria's saint sticker pressed into my skin. I pictured my mother leaving another voicemail, her voice soft and disappointed. I pictured my father, his hands callused and practical, telling me to come home. I pictured the silence of my room in Essex, the wallpaper my sister and I picked when we were twelve, the posters I hadn't taken down. I couldn't go back to that. Not yet. Not without something to show.

Rafa's number hovered at the top of my messages, unread. I had left her on read since breakfast. I imagined her in Alfama, in another hostel with another kitchen, waiting for me to choose her over the light. The thought made me tired, the kind of tired that isn't about sleep.

Joana came up the stairs, her keys jangling. She saw me slumped against the wall and frowned. "You went in," she said.

"For a minute," I said.

"You can't keep doing this," she said, and the words were tired, not angry. She was tired of being the only adult in a building full of adults who refused to act like it.

"I just need one shot," I said. "One." The word tasted like desperation.

She leaned on the wall next to me and stared at the floor. "Pedro will not listen. The owner will not listen. The gas company will not come. We are in a loop." She glanced at my hand, at the lighter. Her eyes softened. "Don't be the spark."

"I'm not even smoking," I said. "It's for a video."

She sighed. "Sometimes the reason is worse." She pushed off the wall. "If you must, open the door and keep it open. And don't use the back burner. And don't light anything. And don't be stupid." She paused. "You see the problem?"

"Yeah," I said. I didn't laugh.

She started to walk away, then turned back. "The window is painted shut," she said. "I tried to scrape it last year. It's a fire hazard. It's all a fire hazard." She looked at me, really looked. "You can leave. You are not trapped here."

I wanted to tell her I was. I wanted to tell her about the brand deal, the bank app, the pressure in my chest when I thought about being ordinary. I wanted to tell her that I didn't feel trapped in the building, I felt trapped in myself.

Instead, I said, "I'll be careful."

She shook her head and left. Her keys jingled all the way down the stairs, like a warning in a different language.

I took a deep breath and felt the air scrape my throat. It was clean. It was real. I could have walked out the front door right then. I could have called a taxi. I could have messaged Rafa. I could have left the lighter on the windowsill and gone to find a cafe with an open terrace and no gas lines.

I didn't.

I went upstairs instead, back to the dorm, as if a change of floor could change the story. The room smelled like stale perfume and damp towels. My bed was a tangle of white sheets and fast-fashion clothing. I caught my reflection in the locker mirror and didn't recognize the face for a second, the one with smudged mascara and a faint flush on the cheeks. I looked like someone who had been up too early for too many mornings, chasing light that never stayed.

From the window, Lisbon rolled out in terracotta and blue, laundry lines strung like flags, a tram squealing its way up the hill. It was beautiful in the way postcards are beautiful, distant and neat. I leaned my forehead against the glass and felt its cold, trying to soak some of it into my skin. My phone buzzed again, a thirst I couldn't satisfy. I didn't open it. The lighter warmed in my palm, and I told myself it was just an object, not a choice.

Someone in the bed across from mine whispered into their phone in Spanish, their voice low and intimate, the kind of real life I always filmed around but never into. I listened to the murmurs, the small laugh, the way the person on the other end made them feel soft. I hated how much it soothed me. I hated how quickly it made me feel lonely.

I swapped my hoodie for a white linen shirt, the one that looked expensive on camera and wrinkled off it. I pulled my hair back, then let it fall loose again, chasing that just-woke-up messiness. I checked the ring light battery, the phone storage, the little practicalities that made the lie possible.

I pushed off the wall and walked back toward the kitchen, the lighter hot in my hand. The door was open again. It was always open now, a mouth waiting to be fed.

On the way, I passed the notice board by reception, the one with flyers for walking tours and fado nights and a handwritten sign that said DO NOT STEAL THE SPOONS. Someone had taped a new printout over the old warning. It was a screenshot of a tweet, the kind people put up like jokes: *If it smells like gas, it's probably gas.* Underneath, someone had scribbled in pen, *But the light is good.*

I stared at it, not sure if I should laugh or cry. Dark humor is a form of survival. In that hallway, I couldn't tell which one I was doing.

Rafa's message came through as I reached the kitchen door. *We can check in anytime. Come.*

I held my phone in one hand and the lighter in the other, the weight of both pressing down. The door breathed. The tiles glowed. The smell rose like a tide.

I stepped in.

---

By the time I returned, the kitchen had thinned again. The breakfast rush was over. The room wore the leftover chaos of toast crumbs and half-drunk coffee cups. The air felt warmer, thicker, like a scarf pulled too tight.

Yuki was gone. Lucas was gone. Dylan was gone. Only a young couple sat at the far end of the table, whispering over a guidebook. They glanced up as I switched on the ring light, then looked away, polite and uninterested.

The stove was still on. The front burner's flame was lower now, but it danced oddly, a thin tongue of blue that flickered as if it was trying to speak. The hiss behind it was louder. I could hear it even in my ribs.

I set my phone up again, rewinding the idea of the shot in my head. The espresso cup had gone cold. I replaced it with a new one, fresh steam curling up. I arranged the cigarette on a small saucer, the filter aligned just right. I placed Maria's lighter beside it like a question.

The warning notice hung crooked on the door, its tape peeling. It was still in frame. It made the shot look edgy. It made the shot look like a confession.

I started recording and brought my face close to the camera. The ring light made my pupils into two neat circles, a kind of artificial sincerity. "Okay," I whispered, like I was talking to a friend. "We're doing this now."

My thumb found the lighter wheel, familiar and rough. I thought about Maria's hand, about the saint sticker, about her saying, You are just the match. I thought about Joana telling me I could leave. I thought about Rafa waiting in Alfama. I thought about the bank app numbers like a heartbeat.

I flicked the wheel once, softly. It didn't spark. It was a dry click, a rehearsed motion. The sound made me flinch. The camera caught it. It looked like tension, like drama. It would look good in a reel.

I flicked again. A tiny, hesitant spark appeared, then died. It was nothing, a blink. The gas smell in the room deepened as if it had been waiting for that.

The couple at the table looked up. The girl frowned, then nudged the boy. They whispered and gathered their things. They left without looking at me.

The kitchen was empty now. For the first time all morning, it was just me, the tiles, the stove, and the hiss.

I should have left then. The room felt wrong. The air felt thick enough to touch. The light was perfect, yes, but it was the kind of perfect that comes right before the storm.

I didn't leave. I stepped closer to the table.

The hiss became a clear, steady note. I could locate it now, behind the stove, a soft ribbon of sound that curled under the tile. It made the hairs on my arms rise. I glanced at the back of the stove, at the gas pipe, at the little flexible connector with its patch of rust. It looked like a vein in an old arm. I thought about touching it. I didn't.

I tried the window again. I pressed my palm to the paint and shoved. Nothing. The window was a sealed eye. I scraped at the latch with my thumbnail, feeling paint flake off in soft curls. It didn't budge. The window would not open. The room would not breathe.

I wedged the door open with the ring light stand like before. The draft from the hallway was weak, but it was something. The warning notice flapped and slapped against the frame. It felt like a slap.

I returned to the table, sat down, and took a slow breath. It tasted metallic. My head buzzed. The tiles swam slightly when I looked at them too long. I told myself it was hunger. I told myself it was the light. I told myself the gas was only a smell.

I glanced at my phone. The brand rep had stopped messaging. They had moved on. The urgency in my chest was my own now, a self-made emergency. That was somehow worse.

"One take," I whispered.

I hit record.

"Okay, so," I murmured, in that intimate voice I saved for stories. "This is my favorite part of Lisbon. The tiles, the light, the way everything feels like it's been here forever." I smiled into the lens. The smile felt like a mask, but it looked like me.

I lifted the cigarette, tilted the lighter. I held them in frame like props in a performance, because they were. I told myself I could stop before the spark. I told myself a half-light would be enough. I told myself the client wouldn't know the difference.

The hiss threaded through my words. The flame on the stove fluttered and dipped. The air felt heavy, sluggish, like it didn't want to move.

I flicked the lighter, harder this time. The wheel scraped. The spark jumped. For a fraction of a second, a flame caught, blue and thin. It kissed the top of the lighter, a tiny tongue, then went out. It was the smallest fire I had ever seen. It was a promise.

My breath stopped. My heart stuttered. The room held its breath with me.

Nothing happened. The flame died, and the air remained still. The hiss continued. The kitchen did not explode. The world did not end.

Relief washed through me, hot and dizzying. The danger hadn't punished me. The danger had let me off. It felt like permission.

I leaned in, closer, and flicked again.

The flame caught, steady this time. It rose clean and blue, tiny and perfect. The light from it was warm, real. It made the cigarette glow at the tip, unlit but ready. It made my skin look golden. It made the shot look exactly like I had imagined in my head.

I held it there for one, two, three seconds, and the camera drank it in.

The hiss sharpened. The stove flame flared, a sudden taller lick, as if startled. The lighter flame trembled in response, like it felt the change in the air.

My lungs tingled. The smell of gas was thick enough to taste. My eyes watered. A headache bloomed behind my forehead.

"Okay," I whispered. "Okay. That's enough."

I released the lighter wheel. The flame died. The room stayed still. The camera kept recording.

I should have stopped. I should have reached for my phone and ended the clip. I should have left the kitchen, left the hostel, left the life.

Instead, my thumb rolled the wheel again. Once you see how perfect it could be, it's hard to stop.

The lighter sparked. The flame caught. It was beautiful. It was everything. It was, for two seconds, all the approval I had ever wanted.

Then the door to the hallway swung shut.

It wasn't a dramatic slam, just the quiet click of a latch, the soft hush of wood meeting wood. The draft stopped. The warning notice stilled. The room felt smaller, tighter, as if it had pulled its mouth closed around me.

The hiss became the loudest sound in the kitchen.

I held the flame in my hand and felt the air thicken around it. The tiles glowed blue-white under the ring light. The stove flame flickered, taller now, hungry. The window stayed shut, its painted seams glaring in the light.

My phone kept recording. The red dot blinked. The frame was perfect.

I should have put the flame out. I should have turned around and opened the door. I should have called out. I should have done a thousand things that would have been wiser than standing there.

My thumb tightened on the wheel.

The lighter flame steadied, a tiny sun in a gas-filled room.

Outside the door, footsteps faded down the hallway. The kitchen was quiet, the kind of quiet that feels like someone holding their breath.

"Just a second," I whispered.

The flame burned on.
