# Chapter 23: The Flame That Waits

The flame was a tiny sun held over a room full of sleeping storm.

---

It hovered between my thumb and the cigarette like a promise I couldn't afford to keep. The lighter's plastic was hot against my skin, Maria's saint sticker peeling as the heat softened the glue. The flame steadied, a blue teardrop with a yellow heart, and for a second it felt like the world held still just to watch it.

The kitchen held still too.

The door was shut. The draft had died. The warning notice hung flat against the wood, no flutter, no breath. The hiss behind the stove was clear, a line of sound with no break in it, like a cassette tape that had lost the song and kept the noise. The air felt thick enough to press against my cheeks. It tasted metallic and sweet, like licking a coin that's been held in someone's sweaty hand too long.

I should have put the flame out. I should have opened the door and let the hallway air wash it away. I should have done anything that wasn't standing still with a spark in a room full of gas.

Instead I leaned in closer to the phone and smiled.

The ring light made the tiles glow with impossible clarity. The blue-and-white pattern looked like it had been painted a minute ago, wet and perfect. My face was a bright oval, my eyes two clean halos. I looked like the version of myself that brands bought. I looked alive.

I moved the lighter closer to the cigarette, close enough to make it look lit without actually touching. That was the trick. Close enough for the illusion, far enough for the truth. The camera didn't know the difference. The camera believed everything.

The hiss rose, or maybe I only heard it because I was paying attention to anything that wasn't the flame. The stove flame flickered in sympathy, a nervous blue tongue. The gas smell thickened. I could feel it fill the room, a heavier-than-air blanket climbing slow and sure up my legs.

I held my breath and counted.

One. The flame held.

Two. The flame wavered.

Three. A floorboard creaked in the hallway outside. Footsteps. The door handle turned.

The door opened and a gust of hallway air punched the flame sideways. It skittered like a frightened insect, bending sharp and almost touching the cigarette. My heart kicked hard enough to make me dizzy.

A German guy I didn't know stepped in, towel around his waist, toothbrush in his mouth. He blinked at me, at the lighter, at the cigarette. His eyes flicked to the NO SMOKING sign and then back to me.

"No smoking," he said around the toothbrush. His accent made it sound like a fact rather than a warning.

"It's a prop," I said, and blew out the flame with a quick breath that tasted like gas.

He shrugged like this was someone else's problem. He walked to the sink, spat, rinsed. The sound of water was almost soothing. The hiss stitched itself through it.

I lowered the lighter to the table, hands shaking. The flame was out, but my thumb still tingled as if it had been burned. The camera was still recording. The shot had the flame for three seconds and a sudden, messy gust that flared it, like drama. It looked real. It looked dangerous. It looked good.

"You're really doing that in here?" the German asked, toothpaste foam on his chin now.

"I was just filming," I said. "It's done."

He looked past me at the stove, at the little flame dancing under an empty pot. "You guys are crazy," he said, and left.

The door swung shut behind him and the room shrank again.

I should have stopped then. I could have cut the clip, taken the three seconds of flame, and left. I could have called it a win. I could have walked away from the kitchen with a little heat in my hand and a little luck in my pocket.

But the flame had been beautiful for such a short time. It hadn't been long enough. It hadn't been perfect.

The cigarette still sat unlit on the saucer, pale and useless. The espresso cup had cooled again. The hiss was a steady line in the air, a sound that kept me company when no one else would. The tiles were still the best backdrop I'd ever seen.

I told myself I could do it once more. Just to be sure. Just to have options.

I flicked the lighter again.

The flame caught immediately, as if it had been waiting. It bloomed in my palm. I felt the heat against my knuckles, the little pinch of pain that reminded me I was real. The gas smell grew stronger, or maybe the flame just made it easier to notice. I held the flame to the cigarette, close enough for the camera to read it as contact.

My phone buzzed on the table, a vibration that rattled the saucer. I ignored it. I had ten seconds, and the world had already taken too many.

Behind me, the stove flame flared higher, a sudden blue lick that made my scalp prickle. The hiss sharpened, a higher pitch now, like a kettle about to scream. I glanced over my shoulder, and in that glance, my hand wobbled.

The flame brushed the cigarette tip for real.

It was nothing. A whisper of ember, a faint orange glow for half a second. No smoke, no drag. But it was contact. It was the thing the warning notice had been waiting for all morning.

The lighter flame trembled. The air felt like it thickened around it, pressing closer. For a heartbeat, I thought I felt a pressure change, like the room was inhaling.

Then the kitchen door opened again.

This time it wasn't a guest. It was Maria, the cleaner, carrying a bucket that sloshed. She stopped when she saw me, her mouth thinning, her eyes sharp as nails.

"No fire," she said.

I blew out the flame so fast I almost inhaled it. "It's done," I said. "I'm done."

She walked past me without answering, set her bucket down by the sink, and reached for the window latch with the same determination I'd had. She pulled hard. The paint held. She cursed in Portuguese, a low, tired sound.

"They paint it shut," she muttered. "They paint the air."

"I'm leaving," I said, more to myself than her.

"Good," she said. She picked up a sponge like a weapon. "Do not come back."

Her words hit me harder than they should have. My throat burned, part gas, part shame. I stopped the recording and picked up my phone, my hands damp. The screen showed my face, the flame, the cigarette, the warning notice in the background. It looked like a confession. It looked like a crime.

"You should turn it off," I said, nodding at the stove. It was weak, a way to do something helpful without really doing anything.

"It doesn't turn off," she said. "The pipe is crying."

She scrubbed at a stain on the counter. The sponge squeaked. The hiss never changed.

I backed toward the door, the ring light stand clutched in my other hand. The kitchen felt like a trap now, the tiles a cage. The smell was in my hair, on my clothes, on my skin. It would follow me out.

I stepped into the hallway and the air there felt thin and clean, not exactly safe but at least honest. I pulled the door closed behind me and heard the click. The hiss dampened, but it didn't disappear. It was still there, soft through the wood, like a heartbeat behind a wall.

My phone buzzed again. I looked down.

*BrandRep:* Need flame, in good light. Is it done?

I stared at the message until the words blurred. My thumb hovered over the reply bar. I could lie. I had a clip. I could send it. It would probably be enough. It would almost certainly be enough.

But I was tired of almost. I was tired of not quite perfect.

I walked out into the courtyard instead, letting the door swing shut behind me. The lemon tree was damp with the last of the morning fog. The air smelled like wet leaves and espresso and the faint sting of smoke from Maria's cigarette. The sky was bright and sharp, the kind of blue that makes everything else look more real.

Rafa was there, sitting on the low wall by the orange crates, her backpack at her feet. She looked like someone waiting at a station for a train she wasn't sure would come. When she saw me, she smiled, but it was small.

"You're still here," she said.

"Just shot something," I said.

"In the kitchen?"

"Yeah." I dropped the ring light stand on the ground and sat opposite her. My hands were shaking in a way I could no longer blame on caffeine.

She gave me a look that could have been pity, could have been anger. "You're gonna end up on the news," she said. "And not in the cute way."

"Any press is good press," I said, and the joke tasted like ash.

She reached into her pocket and pulled out her phone. "I checked out," she said. "Alfama hostel has a roof terrace and a kitchen that doesn't smell like a gas leak. They even have a Nespresso machine. It's a slay." She tried to make it sound like my language, to meet me where I lived.

"I'm not leaving today," I said.

She exhaled hard. "Why?"

"Because I need to finish this. Because I need one payment so I don't have to call my dad and tell him he's right." The words came out sharper than I meant them to.

Rafa softened. "He'll still love you if he's right."

I looked at the lemon tree instead of her. Its leaves were glossy and wet. Its fruit was small, green, not ready. "Maybe that's the problem," I said.

She shifted closer, lowered her voice. "It's not just the gas. It's you. You're doing this to yourself."

"I'm doing my job," I said automatically, and then hated how it sounded.

She nodded, like she didn't want to fight. "Fine. But if you're staying, at least don't light anything in there. Please."

I laughed softly. "Too late."

Her eyes sharpened. "Sienna."

"It was just a second," I said. "Just enough for the clip." I held up my phone, the recorded thumbnail visible, a frozen frame of my hand and the flame. In the still, the warning notice was crisp and yellow behind me, a joke I couldn't stop making.

She stared at it for a long moment. "That's insane," she said.

"Welcome to my feed," I said.

We sat in silence for a while, listening to the city. The tram rattled up the hill. A gull screamed. Somewhere nearby, someone played a guitar badly. The hostel around us buzzed with the soft chaos of people coming and going. It all felt normal, which only made the smell of gas still clinging to my clothes feel worse.

Rafa stood. "I'm leaving in ten," she said. "If you want to come, you know where I'll be." She hesitated, then added, "If you stay, at least message me so I know you're alive."

"I will," I said. It was another small lie.

She picked up her backpack and walked out the front gate without looking back. I watched her go until she turned the corner and disappeared.

My phone buzzed again. I opened the message.

*BrandRep:* We need flame on the cigarette, actual light. Not just a lighter in frame. Can you do that?

There it was. The line I had been avoiding. The excuse I had been using to justify everything. The flame had to touch the cigarette. It had to be real. Authentic. The word made me want to laugh.

I stared at the screen. The courtyard felt too bright. The lemon tree's leaves looked sharp enough to cut. The gas smell in my hoodie seemed louder than the city.

I typed, deleted, typed again.

*Me:* I can get it. Need to redo in better light. Tomorrow AM.

I hit send and felt the weight settle in my chest. It wasn't relief. It was a plan. Plans are chains when you're tired.

---

The rest of the day passed in the sticky way afternoons do when you don't have anything to do and you can't let yourself relax.

I tried to edit the clip from the kitchen. It was fine. It was good, even. The flame glowed in my hand, the tiles shimmered, my face looked calm despite the panic humming under my skin. But when I watched it back, I could see the warning notice too clearly. I could see the door closing in the background, the moment the draft stopped. I could see the flicker in my eyes when the stove flame jumped. The camera didn't lie as much as I liked to believe. It caught the fear I was pretending wasn't there.

I posted a different story instead, a safe one: the courtyard lemon tree, a filter that made the leaves look more golden, a caption about slow mornings. The likes were small and polite. Nobody commented on the gas.

By late afternoon, the hostel was full of new people dragging rolling suitcases up the stairs, their wheels clacking like teeth. Joana stood at reception with her computer and her patient face, smiling and scanning passports. Pedro floated nearby, wearing his friendliness like a shield. He laughed too loudly at jokes that weren't funny. He kept glancing at the kitchen door as if it might bite him.

I passed by the notice board again and stopped. Someone had added another scribble under the tweet: *Don't die for content.* The handwriting was slanted, the ink black and thick. I didn't recognize it. It felt like someone had written it for me.

In the common room, a group of digital nomads held a meeting about their startup. They used words like scalability and disrupt. I sat on the couch behind them and watched the light on the wall. It was pretty. It would have made a good shot. I didn't take it.

Around sunset, I went up to the rooftop because it was the one place in the hostel where the air felt clean. The terrace looked out over Lisbon's terracotta rooftops, the river a dull silver ribbon in the distance. The sun slid down behind the hills and the sky turned the color of bruised peaches. People gathered with beers, with phones, with that soft, temporary intimacy you only get when you know you'll never see each other again.

Dylan was there, leaning on the railing. He nodded at me when I came over. "You okay?" he asked.

"Yeah," I said. "Just tired."

He glanced at my phone. "Did you get your shot?"

"Sort of." I didn't want to explain. I didn't know how to explain.

He was quiet for a moment. The wind tugged at his hair. "You should get out of there," he said finally. "That kitchen is bad news."

"You're still here," I pointed out.

"I'm leaving tomorrow," he said. "My board's in Ericeira. I can't miss the swell." He smiled, then added, "You should come. Surfing doesn't need good lighting."

I laughed. "I don't even own a swimsuit."

"We can fix that," he said. He looked at me in a way that felt like a question. I looked away because I didn't want to answer.

The music from someone's speaker changed to a slow song. A couple danced near the string lights. The air smelled like beer and sunscreen and the distant ocean. For a while, I could pretend the kitchen didn't exist.

Then my phone buzzed again. The brand rep had reacted to my earlier message with a thumbs-up emoji. No words. No urgency. Just permission to try again.

I stared at the screen until the light from it hurt my eyes. The city below us looked like a postcard. My reflection in the dark phone screen looked like a ghost.

When I went down to the common room, the vibe had shifted from sunset romance to leftover noise. People were sprawled on the couches, shoes kicked off, half-finished bottles on the table. The old record player in the corner crackled through a jazz track that didn't match any of us. The air smelled like spilled beer, cheap cologne, and the faint, stubborn line of gas that lived in the walls no matter how high you climbed.

Joana and Pedro were in the hallway by reception, their voices low. I heard her first, sharp and tired. \"We need the company. We need an inspection. You promised.\" Her Portuguese flattened the words into stones. I stayed in the doorway and listened like a thief.

Pedro replied in English, for my benefit or his own. \"What do you want me to do? No hot water, no bookings. We close and we die anyway.\" He rubbed his face with both hands. He looked older than he had this morning.

\"We are already dying,\" Joana said. \"Just slowly.\"\n\nHe huffed a laugh. \"Dramatic.\"\n\n\"It's not dramatic if it's true.\"\n\nHe looked toward the kitchen door as if it had been eavesdropping too. \"Tomorrow,\" he said, in a voice that was almost a plea. \"We'll call tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Tomorrow doesn't breathe the gas today,\" she said. She spotted me and went quiet, her mouth tightening. Pedro followed her gaze and plastered on a smile.\n\n\"Everything okay?\" he asked.\n\n\"Fine,\" I said automatically. It was the only line I knew.\n\nHe nodded and walked away, his keys jangling. Joana didn't move. She studied me with an expression that was neither anger nor pity, just a kind of exhausted clarity.\n\n\"You are still here,\" she said.\n\n\"Just for the night,\" I said. It was half a lie, half a wish.\n\n\"There is a smell in your hair,\" she said, a soft accusation. \"You go back in that room and you are making a deal with a devil that doesn't care about your deal.\" She paused, then added, \"If you need a job, I can ask my cousin at the cafe down the street. She needs help.\" The offer was small and practical and too human. It scared me more than the gas.
\n+\"Thanks,\" I said, and smiled, and it hurt.
\n+My phone buzzed again, not a text this time but a call. Mum. Her name glowed on the screen, bright and soft. I let it ring until it stopped. The silence afterward felt heavier.
\n+She left a voicemail. I stood in the stairwell and listened, the echo of my own breathing loud in my ears. \"Hi, love,\" she said, and I could hear the kettle in the background, the familiar click of our kitchen at home. \"Just checking in. I saw your sunrise post. It was beautiful. Are you eating? Are you safe? Call me back when you can. I miss you.\" She hesitated, then added, almost in a whisper, \"If you're tired, you can come home. It's okay to come home.\" The beep cut her off.
\n+I pressed my forehead against the cool plaster. The stairwell smelled like dust and lemon cleaner. The hiss from downstairs threaded its way up the steps, faint but present, a reminder that even in the quiet corners there was no real silence. I thought about my mother's kitchen, about the steady blue flame under her teapot, about how safe I'd always assumed fire was. I thought about how different the light looked there, softer, less sharp. I thought about how I'd spent years running from that light as if it was a trap.
\n+I didn't call her back. I went to the common room and scrolled instead, as if the glow of my screen could replace warmth.

I went back downstairs before the string lights felt too much like a fire hazard. The staircase smelled like damp stone. The hostel was louder now, people coming back from dinner, laughing, the smell of wine and fried fish clinging to their clothes. The kitchen door was open. The hiss was faint, lost under the noise, but it was still there if you listened.

I didn't go in. I didn't need to. I had made my decision.

In the dorm, I packed my bag halfway, then unpacked it. I laid out my linen shirt and my cigarette on the bed like a ritual. I charged my phone, checked the ring light battery, set my alarm for 4:47 AM. The numbers glowed red on the screen, the same as my bank app. I set a second alarm for 4:50, and a third for 5:00. I didn't trust myself anymore.

My roommates drifted in late, loud and drunk. They fell into their bunks with giggles and whispered gossip. I lay on my back and stared at the underside of the bunk above me, the slats like a cage.

The gas smell wasn't as strong up here, but it was still there, a faint metallic thread woven into the stale dorm air. Maybe it was just in my hair now. Maybe I couldn't tell the difference.

I turned over, pulled the blanket up to my chin, and tried not to think about the kitchen. I tried not to think about the hiss. I tried not to think about the flame.

Sleep came slow. When it did, it tasted like smoke.

---

I woke in the dark to a noise I couldn't place.

It was a hiss, but thinner, more distant, like steam escaping a kettle down the hall. For a moment I thought I was back in the kitchen, the ring light buzzing, the tiles shining, the flame balanced on my thumb. I reached for my phone, my hand moving in the dark like muscle memory.

The dorm was quiet. My roommates breathed softly, their exhale a chorus. The window was a black rectangle, the city outside asleep. The hiss continued, a steady thread beneath everything.

I checked the time. 3:12 AM. My alarms were still hours away.

I sat up in bed and listened. The sound wasn't in the room. It was in the building, in the walls, in the pipes. It was the same sound I'd been hearing all day, only now there were no voices to cover it.

I thought about getting up, about going to Joana, about banging on Pedro's door and telling him to shut the gas off. I thought about going to the kitchen and turning the stove off myself. I thought about the painted window and the warning notice and the way the door breathed when it opened.

Then I thought about the brand deal and the light in the morning, the way it would hit the tiles, the way the cigarette would glow if I could just get it right. I thought about Rafa already gone, about Dylan leaving tomorrow, about the money on my screen. I thought about all the things that felt heavier than fear.

I lay back down.

The hiss kept me company until my next alarm went off. When the screen lit at 4:47, my heart had already been awake for hours.

I rolled out of bed, careful not to wake anyone. The linen shirt felt cold when I pulled it on. I grabbed the ring light case, the cigarette, Maria's lighter. The saint sticker stared up at me in the dark. I took it as a blessing.

The hallway was silent. The tiles under my bare feet were colder than the air. The kitchen door was at the end, a dark rectangle in the dim light. The warning notice still hung there, a pale square in the night.

I paused with my hand on the knob. The hiss was louder here, a soft urgent whisper. The smell of gas was already strong, even with the door closed, even with the night air settling.

I opened the door.

The kitchen breathed in.

I stepped inside.

The flame, I told myself, would be quick.
