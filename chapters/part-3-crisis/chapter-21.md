# Chapter 21: The Fix That Isn't

The tape on the kitchen door looked like a wound you could poke to see if it still hurt.

I did it anyway.

The hallway was cool and grainy with early light, the kind that makes everything look like it wants to be filmed. My phone screen was a moon in my hand. I could smell the building, the damp wood and the detergent from the laundry room, but under it was that sour whisper, the ghost of rotten eggs that clung to the tiles like old smoke.

I pushed the door open with my shoulder, just enough to slip through. The yellow notice slapped the frame as it swung, like it was trying to get my attention. The kitchen greeted me with the silence of a closed mouth. No one else. No whispering kettle, no mutter of drawers. Just the hum of the city outside and the soft, awful patience of the room.

My ring light flicked on and turned the blue tiles into a fake sky. The floor was cold under my socks. I laid my phone on a coffee cup and felt the familiar thrill of a frame coming together. Tiles, table, espresso cup. It was everything I wanted, minus the flame. Always the flame.

I slid the cigarette out of my pocket. I could taste it already, smoke and shame. I twirled it between my fingers like a prop, then set it on the table next to the cup. I told myself I could stage the flame with a candle, with a match, with anything that wasn't my own stupidity. I told myself I wouldn't actually light anything. I told myself the gas was off. The tape said it was off. The warning said danger, but the danger had an off switch, right?

The air was thicker here. Not enough to make me gag, just enough to make my eyes feel dry. The smell was low, lurking at ankle level. I breathed through my mouth and tasted pennies.

There was a hiss.

It was faint, like a snake sleeping in a pipe. I froze. My hand hovered over the lighter in my hoodie pocket. I listened again. The hiss came and went, a soft pulse under the silence.

I told myself it was the building settling. I told myself it was the street outside. I told myself anything that made the hiss not a leak.

I pulled the lighter out anyway.

Not to use it. Not yet. I just wanted to feel the weight. The BIC was scratched and cheap, the kind that appears in every drawer in every hostel kitchen. It was a little relic of a thousand bad decisions. I rolled it between my fingers and watched its red plastic catch the ring light.

The hiss continued. The air felt damp, heavy, like breathing into a plastic bag. I clicked my phone to record, framing the tiles, the cup, the cigarette, my hand with the lighter. In the preview, my fingers were graceful, my nails clean, my hoodie cuff just messy enough to look effortless.

If I could just capture the shot without the flame, I could fake it later. Edit in a flicker. Overlay a graphic. Lie. I had lied before. I could lie about this.

The hiss got louder.

I looked down at the floor, at the gap between the stove and the wall. A shadow moved there, a thin dark line of nothing that felt too alive. I crouched without thinking, camera still rolling, and the cold tile pressed into my knees. The smell hit me harder now, close to the ground. It was metallic and rotten and familiar. It filled my mouth, coated my tongue, squeezed the back of my throat.

I stood up fast, dizzy. The room tilted, and for a second the tiles looked like they were sliding. I grabbed the edge of the table until the world steadied. The ring light hummed, steady and ignorant.

Okay. Fine. Problem. Real, actual problem. I wasn't a total idiot. I could fix it. I could open the window.

I crossed the kitchen in three quick steps and pushed on the window frame. It didn't move. I put both hands on it and shoved. The paint held, thick and sticky, sealing it shut like varnish on a coffin. I tried the latch. It was painted over, a little fossil of metal. My nails scraped the paint and I felt it flake beneath my fingers, tiny white curls.

"Come on," I whispered. "Just a crack."

It didn't crack.

I looked back at the door. If I kept it open, maybe the air would clear. I wedged the door with the ring light stand, holding it half open, and felt a weak draft from the hallway. It smelled like stale coffee and damp towels, better than the kitchen. I dragged the table closer to the door so the shot would include the lighter, the cup, and the sliver of hallway light. It wasn't the perfect frame. It was a compromise. It was still something.

I hit record again and smiled into the camera. "Morning, guys," I whispered, a voice that was not quite mine. "We are in Lisbon, and it is so early that the city hasn't even woken up yet." The light was cool, the tiles were blue, my skin looked good. I could fix the rest in post. I could fix anything in post.

The hiss pulsed under my words like a heartbeat.

I stopped the recording. My head buzzed. I stared at the lighter on the table and felt a wave of fatigue, not just in my body but in my whole life. It would be so easy to flick it. One tiny flame. Ten seconds. Fifty percent upfront. It would be over. It would be mine.

I sat down instead, because sitting felt like something a reasonable person would do. The chair was cold, the table sticky under my elbows. I watched the light crawl across the tiles as the sun rose. Somewhere outside, a tram clattered and a gull screamed. The normal sounds of Lisbon returned, as if the kitchen didn't exist.

"Just be quick," I whispered, and I didn't know if I meant the shot or my life.

---

The hostel woke up like a dog that wanted to be fed and had just remembered it had teeth.

By seven, the hallway was a parade of damp hair and thin tempers. The shower taps ran cold and the complaints ran hot. People with the kind of confidence that only comes from having a plane ticket and a full bank account marched up to the desk demanding refunds. Pedro smiled like a man trying to keep a balloon from popping.

Rafa found me on the stairs with my ring light case and a headache. "You were in there," she said, and it wasn't a question.

"For a minute," I said. My voice sounded wrong, like I'd slept with a mouthful of coins.

She looked at my eyes. "You look green."

"It's the lighting," I said automatically. "It was blue.

"It's the gas." She grabbed my wrist and tugged me toward the courtyard. "Come outside."

The lemon tree was damp with morning fog. The air smelled like wet leaves and the street's first espresso. I sat on the plastic chair, arms wrapped around myself. My head still buzzed, a tiny swarm behind my eyes.

"You can't fix this," Rafa said. "It's not like your skin tone in Lightroom."

"I can fix one shot," I said. "That's all."

"And then what?" She leaned forward, her face tight. "Then you move hostels, right? You said we'd go to Alfama. I booked it."

"I know." I stared at the lemon tree and tried to feel grateful. It was just a tree. It was not on my grid. It didn't have tiles.

Inside, someone shouted in Portuguese. Pedro's laugh rose in response, too bright. The front door swung open, letting in a gust of street noise and the smell of grilled sardines. The morning was ordinary, which only made the kitchen feel stranger, like a secret that everyone ignored.

Maria came into the courtyard with her kettle, plugging it into the outdoor socket. She looked at me and shook her head. "You go in there, you die," she said flatly, like she was announcing the weather.

"It's off," I said. "The gas is off."

"The gas is never off," she said. She flipped her switch and the kettle whined. "Only sleeping." She made the sign of the cross toward the kitchen door, as if blessing a grave.

Rafa made a face. "She's right," she said. "I saw Pedro with the key to the boiler room."

My stomach dropped. "What?"

"He went downstairs before dawn. He told me hot water 'suddenly' came back."

I sat up. The hiss in my ears wasn't just in my head. "He turned it back on?"

"He wants the showers back," Rafa said. "He wants the complaints to stop." She exhaled, hard. "He wants the money."

The courtyard spun a little. I pressed my palm to the table. If the gas was back on, then the kitchen was filling again. The leak wasn't fixed. The tape and the notice were a costume. The danger was back, but now it was hidden by convenience.

Joana stepped into the courtyard, her hair damp, her face drawn. "He turned it on," she said quietly. "He said the company wouldn't come back until next week. He said the guests will leave if we have no hot water."

"That's illegal," Rafa said.

Joana shrugged without humor. "So is half this building." She looked at me, her gaze sharp. "Don't go in there. Not even for water. Not even for a photo."

My mouth wanted to say okay. My hands wanted to say nothing. "He can't just turn it back on," I said. "Someone could die."

Joana's laugh was brittle. "Yes," she said. "That is why I am telling you not to go in." She rubbed her forehead. "I told him. He doesn't listen."

I thought about Pedro's hand on my shoulder, his smile like a mask. I thought about the tape I peeled off, the hiss in the dark. I thought about my lighter sitting in my hoodie pocket like a hot tooth.

"We should leave," Rafa said.

"After breakfast," I said before I could stop myself.

Rafa stared. "You're not even hungry."

"I need the shot." The words came out raw. I heard them, and I hated them. They were too honest. They were too me.

Joana shook her head. "You are young," she said. "Don't be stupid." She said it in English, the vowels round and heavy, like she wanted to keep it from being a pure insult.

I looked down at my phone. The brand rep had sent another message at 6:52. *Client is waiting. Do you have the flame?*

The question felt like a hook. The world pulled tight around it.

"I'll be quick," I said. "I can vent the room. I can open the door. I won't light anything until it smells normal."

"It never smells normal," Rafa said. "That's the point."

"I'll just get the setup," I said. "I'll just fix it.

Maria snorted. Joana turned away, as if she couldn't watch me decide wrong. Rafa grabbed my arm, and for a second I thought she might actually stop me. Then she let go, because she knew me, and because she was tired of fighting a version of me that only existed on screen.

"If you do this," she said softly, "at least leave the door open." Then she walked back inside.

The hostel swallowed her. I sat in the courtyard alone, listening to the kettle hiss, the lemon tree shiver, the distant clatter of Tram 28. I could hear the kitchen too, a faint breath beneath the noise. It was not a hiss this time, more like a sigh.

I told myself I'd wait. I told myself I'd watch the light for a while, make sure the morning settled. I told myself that if the gas smell stayed strong, I'd go. I told myself the kind of lies that sound reasonable until you say them out loud.

---

By nine, the kitchen door no longer had tape on it.

Pedro must have peeled it off, maybe in a panic, maybe in a decision. The yellow notice still hung there, crooked and useless, but the tape was gone, leaving a pale stripe on the tiles where it had been. The doorway looked normal again, and that normality felt like a dare.

People went in and out with mugs and bowls like nothing had happened. A guy with a man bun made a show of sniffing the air and then shrugged. A French girl with a silk headband set her phone against the sugar jar and filmed herself pouring cereal. The gas smell seeped around their ankles and nobody seemed to notice or care. The danger had been demoted to an inconvenience.

I watched from the hallway, the ring light case heavy on my shoulder. I could have left. I could have followed Rafa to the new hostel in Alfama. I could have shut my laptop and called my mother. I could have asked for a real job.

My bank app was a red smear of numbers. The brand payment, if it came, would buy me a month of pretending. Without it, I would have to answer messages I had been dodging for weeks: my father's, practical and disappointed, and my mother's, soft in a way that made me feel worse. She had left a voicemail last night, asking if I was eating, asking if I was safe, saying that Lisbon looked beautiful in my stories. I had not replied. I had posted a sunrise instead, captioned with a quote about manifesting. The likes were polite. The anxiety was not.

Instead I stepped into the kitchen, because I could fix this. I could fix anything. I could be quick.

The air was warmer now, stirred by bodies and coffee. The smell of gas was still there, but it was hiding under the scent of toast and powdered milk. The hiss was louder with the stove on, a thin whisper behind the metal. A pot rattled on the front burner. Someone had lit it. The flame was a thin blue mouth, flickering just above the metal. Seeing it made my chest tighten and my palms sweat. The room was already playing with fire.

I set my ring light down and unfolded it by the sink. The light snapped on, and everyone looked up, briefly irritated. I smiled, a small apology for existing.

"Sorry," I said. "Just a quick shot."

No one cared. Or they did and didn't want to be the villain on my feed.

I pulled my phone out and set it on the table. The tiles were perfect under the ring light, the blue and white blooming like a pattern I could hide in. The warning notice on the door was visible in the background, a little piece of truth in the frame. It made the scene feel dangerous and that, in an ugly way, made it feel interesting.

"Maybe the warning can be part of it," I muttered. "Danger is a vibe."

The thought was insane, and yet I could already see the comments. *So edgy.* *Queen.* *This is art.* I swallowed the nausea that rose with it.

Dylan walked in, hair damp, wearing board shorts and a towel around his neck. He spotted me and paused. "You're not supposed to be in here," he said.

"I'm just grabbing coffee," I said, because that was easier than the truth.

He glanced at the stove, at the blue flame, at the open door. "It's back on?"

"Apparently." I kept my voice light. "Guess Pedro got over his safety phase."

He ran a hand through his hair. "That's messed, eh." He looked at me like he wanted to say more. He didn't.

The hissing sound grew sharper, and I knew it wasn't my imagination. It was close, behind the stove, a steady sibilance. I could almost see the gas escaping, a clear snake curling along the floor. It felt like it was looking at me.

I stepped back and forced myself to breathe. I counted to five. The air tasted metallic again, sharper than before.

"Maybe we should open the window," Dylan said.

"It doesn't open," I said.

He tried anyway, just to see. He pulled, he shoved, he laughed when it didn't move. "Right. Of course." He shrugged. "They painted it."

"For the aesthetic," I said.

"Yeah," he said. "People die for the aesthetic." He smiled like it was a joke. I didn't.

I tried to focus on the shot. I adjusted the angle, moved the cup. I held the lighter in my hand but kept my thumb off the wheel. I told myself I'd do the flame later, in a safer place. I told myself I'd film the light without the fire. I told myself I'd fake it.

Then the brand rep messaged again. *Client in a meeting. Needs to see flame on camera to approve payment.*

My heartbeat hit my throat. I stared at the screen. The words blurred. The lighter was warm in my palm. The hiss grew louder, or maybe that was just me.

"I'm going to be quick," I whispered.

"What?" Dylan asked.

"Nothing," I said. I set the phone to record. I framed the shot with the tiles, the cup, my hand, the cigarette. I smiled at the camera with the bright, rehearsed smile of someone who is always okay.

The warning notice in the background flapped slightly as someone walked past the door. In the preview, it looked almost like a ghost.

My thumb hovered over the lighter wheel.

I told myself I'd just show the motion. No spark. Just the suggestion of flame. It would be enough. It would be safe.

My thumb was sweating. The wheel was rough under my skin. The hiss was loud now, a thin whistle that sliced through the noise of the room. I looked down at the floor. The air near my feet seemed to shimmer, or maybe my eyes were just dizzy.

"Sienna," Dylan said quietly, and his voice was the only thing that made me pause.

I looked up. His face was pale. He was looking not at me but behind me, toward the stove. His eyes were wide, his mouth slightly open.

I turned.

The blue flame on the stove had grown taller, flickering as if it couldn't decide whether to stay. It flared and dipped, starved and fed, like it was breathing. The hiss was louder, urgent. The smell of gas thickened, all sweetness and rot. The flame made a tiny sound, a whisper of burning.

Pedro walked in, smiling like a man entering a party. "Everything is fine," he said brightly, to no one in particular. "We have coffee again."

Behind him, the hallway was full of guests, shuffling, laughing, yawning. The kitchen filled with bodies, with heat, with breath. The air had no room left.

My lighter was in my hand. My phone was recording. The blue flame danced. The warning notice fluttered.

I thought, for one raw second, that I could fix this. I could tell Pedro. I could turn off the gas. I could move people out. I could be responsible. I could be someone else.

I opened my mouth to speak.

And the power flickered.

The ring light blinked off, then on, then off again. The kitchen dimmed, the tiles turning to dusk. The flicker was small, almost nothing, the kind of electrical hiccup old buildings have when they breathe. But it sent a ripple of panic through the room. Someone laughed. Someone swore. Someone banged the table. The ring light clicked back on, bright and hot.

My phone kept recording, the little red dot steady. The lighter sat in my palm like a heartbeat.

"You okay?" Dylan asked.

"Yeah," I said. "Just a glitch." I swallowed. The air tasted like metal.

The hiss rose to a sharp, steady whistle.

I stepped closer to the table, lifted the lighter, and aimed it toward the cigarette, my thumb poised to spin the wheel. In the frame, it looked perfect. It looked like the shot that would save me.

The gas smelled stronger than ever. The kitchen felt too small. The tiles gleamed, blue and indifferent. The warning notice fluttered, helpless.

I told myself I would be quick.

I told myself I could fix this.

I spun the wheel.

---

The lighter did not spark.

A sweat-slick misfire, a tiny click of metal on metal. No flame. No ignition. Just the raw scrape of a wheel and my own breath catching. The camera recorded the motion, the almost, the nothing.

I exhaled, a shaky laugh that felt like a sob. "Of course," I muttered. "Of course you'd choose now."

I flicked it again. Still nothing. The lighter was empty, or damp, or cursed. I shook it, turned it upside down, tried again. My thumb stung. No flame.

"Need a light?" someone said behind me, and I flinched.

It was the French girl with the silk headband, holding out her own lighter like a peace offering. I stared at it, the tiny promise of fire in her hand, and my mouth went dry.

"No," I said too quickly. "I'm good."

She shrugged and turned away, flicking her lighter to light a candle she had pulled from her bag. The flame leapt up, small and golden, and everyone pretended it was normal.

My phone buzzed with another message. *Did you get the flame?*

My hands were shaking. The hiss was a scream now, or maybe it was just inside my head. The kitchen swayed. I could feel the gas pooling around my ankles like cold fog, invisible and patient. The stove flame danced, the candle flame smiled, the ring light burned like a fake sun.

I stopped the recording and checked the clip. It showed my hand, the lighter, the cigarette, the warning notice in the background, the ring light glow, the tiles. It showed the click, the almost spark, the disappointment. It showed me failing.

The failure felt like mercy. It also felt like a dare.

"I can fix this," I whispered, to myself, to the room, to whatever god watches influencers at six in the morning. "I can fix this." I could get a new lighter. I could borrow the French girl's. I could use a match. I could do it right. I could do it quick.

I shoved the dead lighter into my pocket and grabbed my phone. I needed a new flame. I needed ten seconds. I needed to get it before I lost my nerve.

I pushed through the kitchen toward the courtyard, the air thick and hot, the smell clinging to my hair. The lemon tree outside was bright with sun. Maria sat there again, kettle still steaming, cigarette between her fingers. She looked up as I stepped into the light.

"You are still alive," she said.

"Don't celebrate yet," I said.

She held up her lighter. "Take," she said, as if she was handing me a knife.

I took it. The lighter was warm from her hand, heavy with familiarity. It had a saint sticker on it, worn and peeling. I turned it over, feeling the little ridges, the chipped plastic. I could imagine it sparking, a tiny flame in the morning light. It felt like a gift and a curse.

"You are making a choice," Maria said.

"I'm fixing a problem," I said, and the lie tasted like gas.

She shook her head. "The problem is not you. The problem is the pipe." She pointed toward the kitchen. "You are just the match."

The word hit me like a slap. I tightened my grip on the lighter and felt the edges dig into my palm.

Inside, the room buzzed. Laughter, clinking cups, a Spotify playlist of soft jazz. The warning notice on the door fluttered in the breeze from the hallway, a useless piece of paper in a room full of fire.

I stepped back toward it, lighter in hand, phone in the other, and the smell of gas followed me like a shadow.

The tiles were waiting. The flame was in my pocket.

I could fix this.

I could fix this.

I could fix this.
