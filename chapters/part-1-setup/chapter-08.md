# Chapter 08: The Rules Are for Guests

The morning decided to punish me with a pimple on my chin the size of a moral lesson and a DM that started with "hey girly" and ended with "we only pay in exposure." I lay on my bunk and stared at the ceiling, trying to hold myself perfectly still, as if movement would make the universe notice my bank balance.

The smell was already awake. It seeped through the floorboards like it owned the place, a sickly sweetness that made me think of bad perfume and rotten eggs. I covered my nose with my sleeve and refreshed my notifications. Ten new followers, two comments about the tiles, one question about whether the hostel was safe. The question stared back at me like a dare.

I slid down the ladder and padded into the hallway. My head felt soft around the edges, the way it does when you haven't eaten enough and have slept too little. The dorm door clicked shut behind me. The corridor was dim, and the air was heavier down here, like the building had spent the night holding its breath.

I found Joana at reception, hair pulled back, coffee in a chipped mug. She looked like she had already answered too many questions.

"Morning," I said, which was a lie because it didn't feel like morning, it felt like an obligation.

She nodded. "Bom dia." She glanced up and then down again. "You were up early again?"

"Working," I said, because it was easier than saying I didn't know how to stop.

She slid the guest log toward herself, then glanced past me, toward the kitchen door. "If you go in there, open the courtyard door. Please." Her voice was quiet, the kind of quiet that implies someone told her not to say more.

"Is it worse?" I asked.

She hesitated, the pause long enough for me to hear the reception clock tick. "The owner says it's fine," she said finally, and there was the world she lived in and the world she wanted to live in, divided by six words.

"Pedro's here?" I asked, partly out of curiosity, partly because I wanted to put a face to whoever had decided a smell wasn't a problem.

"He was. He comes in the morning to check the reviews." She gave a small, bitter smile. "He thinks the tiles are more important than the pipes." She took a sip of coffee. "Don't tell him I said that."

"Your secret's safe," I said, because I didn't want to be his problem or hers.

A guy in a tourist tee shuffled in, dragging a suitcase that rattled over the tiles in the hallway. He glanced at the breakfast sign, then at Joana. "Is there hot water?" he asked.

"The kettle," she said, and pointed toward the kitchen with the same hand you might use to gesture toward an old dog that bites.

I waited for him to leave, then asked, "Is he fixing anything?"

"He says he will," she said. "He says a lot." She looked at me, really looked, and softened. "You should go eat. You'll feel better."

I smiled because that was what people expect of me. "I'm fine," I said, because that is what people like me say when we are not.

The kitchen was empty. The table was clean, the tiles gleaming, the houseplant in the corner now fully dead, its leaves curled in like a fist. The room smelled like a chemistry set left in the sun. I set my phone down, just to see the light, and watched the screen adjust. The tiles looked like a catalog shot. Everything else looked sick.

The kettle was still warm from someone else's use. I poured water into a mug and watched the steam rise. Steam is a liar. It looks like comfort even when it comes from a metal coil that smells faintly of pennies. I took a sip and nearly gagged. The coffee tasted like regret, thin and bitter. I set it down and opened the courtyard door as Joana had asked. Cold air slid in. The smell thinned, but so did the light. I closed it halfway, enough to be polite, not enough to ruin the shot.

A girl with a messy bun and a purple hostel bracelet walked in and stopped short. "Oh my god," she said, fanning her face. "It smells like gas."

"It's the drains," I said automatically.

She wrinkled her nose. "Does your drain smell like a funeral?"

"Old building," I said, because that was the script. "Lisbon charm."

She stared at me, then laughed without humor. "My dad's a plumber," she said. "He'd have a heart attack if he walked in here."

"My dad's a tax accountant," I said. "He has a heart attack about my Instagram."

She didn't laugh. She opened the courtyard door all the way. The air rushed in, lifting the edge of the tablecloth, cooling the tiles. The light went flat. My phone adjusted, unhappy. I watched my shot die in real time.

"Sorry," she said, not sorry. "I need to breathe."

I nodded, because I needed to breathe too, and because I didn't want to be the villain in the morning. I picked up my phone, tucked it into my back pocket, and left the kitchen like someone giving up a seat.

By noon, I had posted two stories, deleted one, re-edited the other, and answered three DMs with hearts I didn't feel. My feed was a carousel of tiles and coffee and a close-up of my wrist with a bracelet that said LIVING MY BEST LIFE in tiny gold letters. The irony was almost poetic.

I met Felix at a cafe near Baixa because he had promised me "real Lisbon" and I had promised him a tag. The cafe had tiled floors and older men arguing softly in Portuguese. The espresso machine hissed like the stove back at the hostel, only this hiss made sense. The air smelled like sugar and bitter coffee, not chemicals.

Felix set his camera down and shrugged out of his jacket. "You look tired," he said, as if it was a compliment.

"I am tired," I said. "But it's aesthetic tired."

He smiled. "Is that why you never eat the food you photograph?"

"It's a lifestyle," I said. "You wouldn't get it."

"Try me."

I took a sip of cappuccino and tasted real coffee for the first time in days. It made me feel almost human. "I can't afford to look like I'm trying," I said. "Trying is the enemy."

"Trying is also how you survive," he said, then lifted his camera and took a photo of the bartender without asking. We all have our sins.

I scrolled through my feed while he adjusted his lens. The comment about the gas smell had gotten more likes. Another person had replied, *girl if it smells like gas GET OUT.* I stared at it, then typed *It's fine, just old pipes* and hit send before I could think. The lie felt like swallowing a pill dry.

Felix glanced at my screen. "People worried?"

"They love drama," I said.

"Maybe they're right," he said, and there was no judgment in it, just a flat, practical observation.

"You sound like my mother," I said.

He tilted his head. "She is probably right too."

I exhaled a laugh and looked out the cafe window. A tram rattled past, yellow and bright. A woman leaned out to take a selfie, the same move I had done on my first day. I watched her wobble and steady herself, eyes on the screen instead of the street, and I felt a tiny jolt of recognition that wasn't admiration.

Felix shot me against the window, the light catching my hair. He moved me three inches left, then right. "Turn your chin down."

I did as he said. The camera clicked. The shutter sounded crisp, like a lock closing.

"You should stop lighting cigarettes for your photos," he said without looking up.

"I haven't yet," I said.

"You're going to. I can tell. You have that look." He checked the display, swore softly, then adjusted the aperture. "It's not just about smoke. It's about you doing dumb things for a picture."

"It's my job," I said, defensive by reflex.

He lowered the camera. "It's not a job if it doesn't pay," he said, and that hit harder than I wanted it to. He softened. "I'm not trying to be mean. I'm just saying you can get the vibe without the flame."

"The flame is the vibe," I said, and then regretted it because it sounded like something I'd post in a caption.

He looked at me for a second, then went back to his camera like it was a shield. "Okay," he said. "Then at least light it outside."

I didn't answer. The steam rising from my cup made me think of the kitchen. The hissing of the espresso machine made me think of the stove. The world had started to rhyme, and I didn't like it.

After the cafe, we walked along the river. The air was crisp, the sun a weak October promise. Felix took photos of the bridge, of my boots on the stones, of my reflection in a puddle. I posed because that's what I do, but my mind kept drifting back to the hostel, to Joana's quiet voice, to the girl in the kitchen fanning the air. I told myself I was overreacting. I told myself I was tired. I told myself the light in the kitchen would make all of this worth it.

When we parted, Felix handed me a small memory card. "I'll send you the good ones," he said.

"All of them are good," I said, and he smiled like he had heard that before.

On the way back, I passed the hardware store again. The gas detectors still hung in the window, bright white and indifferent. I stood there longer this time, my reflection layered over the plastic boxes. For a moment, I imagined buying one, plugging it in, becoming the person who listens to warnings instead of filters them. Then my phone buzzed with a new DM and the spell broke. I turned away.

---

I went back to the hostel before the crowds returned, because the light in the kitchen is best when the building is still half asleep. The tiles caught the late-afternoon sun and turned it into something almost holy. I told myself I was only going to shoot a quick story for the skincare brand, a little sink-side routine, soft light, clean face, pretend I wasn't wearing yesterday's mascara. The brand had asked for \"authentic travel content\" and I had nodded, even though my authentic travel content was me calculating what filter would make my pores look like a suggestion.\n+\n+The kitchen was empty again. The table was bare. The smell hit me as soon as I crossed the threshold, thicker than earlier, like it had been waiting for the room to be empty so it could stretch out. I set my bag on the bench, pulled out the ring light, and aimed it toward the sink. The sign on the wall glared at me: NO SMOKING IN KITCHEN. I wasn't smoking. I wasn't even thinking about smoking. I was thinking about how to angle the serum bottle so the label faced the light without looking staged.\n+\n+The stove was quiet, but I could hear a faint hiss behind it, like a kettle on the edge of boiling. It was so soft I could have convinced myself it was the building settling. I stood still and listened. It didn't stop. The air felt heavy, the kind of heavy you feel before a storm, only there were no clouds, just tiles.\n+\n+I turned on the tap. The water sputtered, then came out in a thin stream. I wet my face, patted it dry with a paper towel, then held up the serum bottle to the camera. \"Hey guys,\" I said in my softest voice, my best morning voice. \"I've been using this new hydrating serum while traveling, and I'm obsessed.\" I looked at myself on the screen and didn't look obsessed. I looked tired. I added a smile anyway.\n+\n+Halfway through the second take, the pilot light on the stove clicked and went out with a small sigh. I noticed, a flicker of blue gone, and then I pushed it away. The sound of the refrigerator filled the space, a low hum. I kept talking about hyaluronic acid, about \"dewy,\" about the importance of protecting your skin from \"city stress.\" The air tasted metallic. My tongue went numb at the edges.\n+\n+I finished the take and replayed it. The lighting was good. My hair was frizzy, but that's what \"effortless\" is supposed to look like. I set the phone down and took a breath through my mouth. My stomach turned. I told myself it was because I had eaten nothing but coffee and a stale croissant. I told myself it was fine.\n+\n+The door creaked, and a man stepped in, older than most of the guests, with a weathered face and a knit cap. He wore work boots and held a plastic bag with bread sticking out of it. He looked around, then looked at me. He frowned, the kind of frown that doesn't need a translation.\n+\n+\"Cheira a gas,\" he said, and pointed at the stove.\n+\n+\"The drains,\" I said automatically, because it was a spell I'd learned.\n+\n+He shook his head. \"Nao. Gas.\" He walked to the painted window and tried the latch. It didn't move. He jiggled it, then knocked on the glass like it might wake up. It didn't. He muttered something under his breath and went to the courtyard door, yanking it open. Cold air rushed in. The smell thinned, the light died.\n+\n+\"Desculpa,\" I said, because I wasn't sure what else to say.\n+\n+He shrugged, set his bag on the table, then hesitated. He looked at the stove again, then at me, then at the sign on the wall. He said something in Portuguese that sounded like a warning and a complaint rolled into one. Then he took his bread and left, the door swinging shut behind him.\n+\n+The kitchen felt too quiet after he left. I closed the courtyard door halfway again and told myself I was being reasonable. I told myself I would open it again after I got the shot. I told myself it was just for five minutes.\n+\n+I went back to the sink and reached for the serum bottle. My hand was slightly shaky. I took another breath and felt the air scratch the back of my throat. My phone buzzed with another DM from the brand. *Can you also mention our SPF?* I stared at the message, then typed back, *Of course!* with a heart. It felt like signing a contract with a ghost.\n+\n+I started another take, forced a bright smile, and said, \"Don't forget sunscreen, even in October.\" The words sounded fake coming out of my mouth, but the camera didn't care. The camera never cares. The camera just eats light.\n+\n+When I finished, my head was pounding in a slow, polite way. I shut the ring light off and sat on the bench for a moment, elbows on my knees, breathing through my mouth. The tiles across from me were beautiful, perfect, indifferent. The dead plant slumped in the corner like a reminder. I took a photo of it, blackened leaves against the blue wall, and thought it might make a good story with a caption about survival. I deleted it before posting. Dead plants don't match my grid.\n+\n+I gathered my things and left the kitchen. The hallway smelled cleaner by comparison, the air less sweet. I paused at reception. Joana wasn't there. The stool was empty, the desk tidy, a note taped to the computer that said BACK IN 10. I could have left a note. I could have told her the pilot light had gone out again, the hiss, the older man who opened the door. Instead I picked up my phone and started editing the skincare story, smoothing my skin, brightening my eyes, shrinking the pimple until it was just a suggestion.\n+\n+By the time I uploaded it, the headache had settled in behind my eyes like a tenant who didn't pay rent. I told myself to drink water. I told myself to eat. I told myself I would do it after one more scroll.\n+\n+---\n+\n The hostel was loud in the late afternoon, everyone returning from tours with sunburn and cheap souvenirs. The common room smelled like sweat and sunscreen. I climbed the stairs and dropped my bag on my bed, then sat for a minute to stare at the empty bunk where Jessa had been. The space looked like an absence you could trip over.
The hostel was loud in the late afternoon, everyone returning from tours with sunburn and cheap souvenirs. The common room smelled like sweat and sunscreen. I climbed the stairs and dropped my bag on my bed, then sat for a minute to stare at the empty bunk where Jessa had been. The space looked like an absence you could trip over.

On my phone, Jessa had posted a photo of a houseplant in a cafe. The caption said, *Alive.* That was it. No hashtags. No filter. It was infuriating in its simplicity. It had twice the comments my tile post had. I stared at it until the screen dimmed.

In the hallway, I heard voices: Joana and a man, low and tight. I slipped my door open a crack.

"Pedro, someone is going to get hurt," Joana said.

"They always say that," he replied in Portuguese-accented English. "Nothing happens."

"The smell is worse," she said. "We had a pilot light go out again."

"The pilot light is sensitive," he said, impatient. "It's an old stove."

"It's an old building," she said. "With gas."

There was a pause. I could imagine the shape of Pedro's shrug in the air. "We cannot close the kitchen," he said. "You know what reviews would do to us?"

"Reviews won't matter if we are on the news," she said.

He laughed, a short, dismissive sound. "No one is on the news for a smell."

I stepped back before they could see me. The conversation stayed with me as I went downstairs, like a small stone in my shoe.

I found Dylan in the courtyard, smoking, legs stretched out on a bench. He looked like he had just come from the beach, all sun and salt. He glanced at me and lifted his cigarette.

"You look haunted," he said.

"That's just my face," I said, and sat beside him.

He offered me his cigarette. I took it and held it between my fingers. The paper felt dry and thin. I didn't light it. "Smells worse today," he said, nodding toward the kitchen door.

"Apparently it's just the drains," I said.

He snorted. "My dad was a firefighter. Drains don't explode."

I laughed, too sharp. "That's dramatic."

"So is smoking inside a building that smells like gas," he said.

"I'm not smoking," I said.

He raised his eyebrows. "Not yet."

I handed the cigarette back. "You guys are all so intense."

"We like living," he said, and took a drag. He exhaled into the lemon tree, smoke curling around the leaves. "You should do your photo thing out here. The light's good in the courtyard in the morning."

"The tiles are inside," I said.

"The tiles are inside a bomb," he said.

I laughed again, but my chest felt tight. The courtyard smelled like lemons and smoke, the air a clean contrast to the kitchen. For a moment, the idea of doing the shot outside felt almost possible. Then I imagined the comments. *Not the same.* *We want the tiles.* *Do it inside.* The audience lives in your head once you let them in.

"I'm only here one more day," I said, because that was the plan I told myself.

Dylan flicked ash onto the tiles. "That's what you said yesterday."

"Yesterday was different," I said.

He gave me a look that said he didn't believe me but wasn't going to argue. "Just be careful," he said. "I like having someone around who knows how to use a filter."

"That's the nicest thing anyone's said to me today," I said.

"Don't let it go to your head," he said, and smiled.

By evening, the hostel had settled into its pre-nightlife rhythm. The rooftop filled with people and light. I went up with a bottle of cheap vinho verde and my phone at 12% battery, the perfect combination for regret. The string lights made everyone's skin look softer. I filmed a slow pan of the skyline and tagged the hostel because that's what they asked me to do for the free night.

Felix waved from a hammock, camera still around his neck. Joana was up there too, sitting on the edge with a beer, shoes off, her feet dangling over the city. She looked tired in a different way than I did.

I sat near her. "Busy day?" I asked.

"Always," she said. "And tomorrow? More." She looked at me, her eyes kind in a tired way. "You leave soon?"

"Tomorrow afternoon," I said. It was a lie. My bus was the next day, but lying about leaving felt safer.

"Good," she said. "Go somewhere with newer pipes."

"Is it really that bad?" I asked.

She stared out over the river. "I grew up in a building like this," she said. "Old things make sounds. They smell. They settle. But this..." She gestured vaguely toward the roof, toward the kitchen, toward the invisible pipes. "This feels like someone ignoring a cough."

"I didn't know you were a poet," I said.

She smiled without humor. "I'm an architect. We learn to see what will fall." She took a sip of beer. "Pedro doesn't like that."

I thought of the conversation in the hallway. I thought of the way he had laughed. "He likes reviews," I said.

"He likes money," she said, and there was no bitterness in it, just fact.

The wind picked up. The string lights swayed. The city looked beautiful and indifferent, the river a dark ribbon. I watched a tram far below, its lights moving like a tiny train in a toy set. I could feel the night cooling, the smell of the kitchen replaced by the smell of beer and the faint smoke from the courtyard. It would have been easy to pretend everything was fine up here.

My phone buzzed. A comment on my earlier post: *Girl are you ok? You look pale in your stories.* I stared at it, then wrote *Just tired lol* and added a sleepy face. The lie felt automatic now, a reflex.

When I went back down, the hallway was quiet. The dorm door clicked. The room smelled like deodorant and damp socks. I changed into a clean top and laid out the clothes for the morning. The cigarette pack sat in my bag like a dare. I pulled one out and held it, rolling it between my fingers. The paper felt familiar. The lighter was cool and heavy in my hand.

I could have left it. I could have put it back. I could have listened to Joana, to Dylan, to Felix, to the comment from a stranger. I could have opened the window. I could have done the shot outside. I could have done a different shot. I could have done nothing.

Instead, I placed the cigarette on the pillow next to my phone, the way you'd lay out earrings for a wedding. I set my alarm for 6:40. I opened the dorm window a crack and let the night air in. It barely moved the smell, but it felt like a gesture.

I lay down and stared at the ceiling. The building creaked. A pipe somewhere hissed, a soft whisper threading through the dark. My thumb traced the ridges of the lighter in the dark, practicing the motion without flame. The shot in my head was so clear I could almost see it in the air: me, the cup, the tiles, the tiny flame.

Outside, a tram clattered, distant and dull. Inside, the smell pooled at the floor like water. I closed my eyes and told myself I would be quick.

Just one spark. Just one shot.
