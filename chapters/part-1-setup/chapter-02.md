# Chapter 02: The Algorithm Is Hungry

The lighter clicked when I tested it, a tiny sound like a secret. I didn't light it. I just wanted to hear it, to feel the familiar weight in my palm, the promise of a tiny flame that could make a photo look like a story instead of a product.

Behind me, the stove whispered. It wasn't a sentence, just a thin sibilant sound like something exhaling. The tiles held the light and threw it back at me. My face looked soft in the phone screen. My eyes looked not-soft. I smiled anyway.

---

I wasn't alone in the kitchen as long as I thought I was. The door creaked and someone came in, shuffling, slippers on tile. It was the cleaner, Maria, the older woman I'd seen in the hallway with a mop and the kind of frown that made you want to behave. She paused in the doorway like she was stepping into a church.

She crossed herself, quick and practiced, then looked at me and my ring light with a kind of wary pity. "Bom dia," she said.

"Morning," I said back, and my voice sounded too loud in the empty room.

She carried a small electric kettle, its cord wrapped around her wrist like a bracelet. She set it on the counter near the sink, nowhere near the stove. She kept her eyes on the counter, not on me, not on the tiled wall that was my altar.

"You don't use the stove?" I asked, because silence makes me itch.

She shook her head. "No." It wasn't a refusal. It was a rule. She plugged in the kettle and the tiny red light clicked on, a polite glow.

The smell sat on the floor and crawled up my legs. It didn't just smell like eggs now. It smelled like eggs left in a hot car, like something sweet rotting under plastic. I breathed through my mouth and told myself I was being dramatic. The camera was on. Dramatic works.

Maria poured instant coffee into a chipped mug and waited. Her eyes flicked to the wall where the gas pipe ran, painted white like a disguise. She muttered something in Portuguese under her breath that I couldn't catch. The kettle began to whine. Her shoulders eased, like the sound of electricity was a comfort.

"Is it always like this?" I asked, fanning the air with my hand. It felt performative even to me.

She raised her eyebrows. "Old building." Then, after a beat, "Bad air." She tilted her chin toward the door. "Open?"

I thought about the light, the way the breeze would flatten it, the way the camera would turn the perfect glow into something ordinary. I shook my head. "It's okay," I said, and didn't add that it was only okay because I needed it to be.

Her kettle clicked off. She poured the water into her mug, stirred, took a sip. The steam curled into my shot. I snapped a photo of her hand on the mug. It looked like a hand that had worked too many jobs and never posted a story about it.

"No smoking," she said, pointing at the sign. Her English was better than my Portuguese.

"It's just for the shot," I said. I lifted the cigarette like a prop in a theater. I hadn't even lit it. I would, later, when the light had peaked, when the reel needed the motion of smoke. I was being responsible. I was also being me.

She watched me for a second too long, then turned away. She took her mug and went out into the courtyard, the door swinging shut behind her. The kettle cord trailed after her like a leash.

I took a breath. The air felt thick, like breathing through a scarf. My head had a tiny ache behind my eyes, a pulse that matched the tremor in my leg. I was hungry. I hadn't eaten since the pastry yesterday afternoon. I told myself the ache was normal. I told myself a lot of things.

I positioned the cup and the cigarette, angled the phone, hit record, and began to pour the coffee for the third take. The stream was brown and thin. The coffee smelled like burnt pennies.

"Hey."

I looked up. Joana, the receptionist, stood in the doorway with a cardigan over her shoulders. Her hair was tied back in the same neat braid. She looked older in the morning, like someone who had been awake long before I stumbled into the kitchen.

"We're doing quiet hours until eight," she said. "Your ring light is loud. It hums." She smiled a little as if she didn't mean to be a killjoy.

"Sorry," I said, and clicked it off. The room dimmed. The tiles went from divine to merely pretty.

She stepped inside, her gaze sweeping the stove, the pipe, the window that refused to open. "The back burner," she said, nodding toward it. "Do not use. Not even for photos, please." The way she said photos made them sound like cigarettes.

"I'm not cooking." I held up my hands.

"I know." She looked at the lighter in my palm. "And no smoking. The owner will be upset. He has rules. We put them in the reviews." She offered another small smile, but it didn't reach her eyes.

I had the thought that my photos were why the rules existed, and that was a strange kind of guilt. "Okay," I said, and put the lighter back in my bag. I didn't like how quickly I obeyed her. It made me feel like a child. It also made me feel, for a split second, safe.

Joana lingered by the stove. Her nose twitched. She opened the cupboard under the sink and pulled out a spray bottle of lemon cleaner, spritzed the air like it could mask a problem. The scent cut the gas smell for a moment, bright and synthetic.

"Do you want breakfast?" she asked.

"Is it free?"

She laughed. "Bread and jam." She pointed toward the common room. "Not eggs. No stove." She said it like a joke. It wasn't.

I followed her out, carrying my phone and my bag, leaving my staged coffee behind. The kitchen door closed, and the smell thinned but didn't disappear. It was everywhere now, in the hallway, in the stairwell, like the building itself was sweating it out.

The common room was a soft cave of couches and old books. A few guests were already there, blinking at their phones, cupping paper cups of coffee. A guy in a hoodie rubbed his temples with both hands.

"Do you guys smell that?" someone asked, a woman with a French accent, not looking up from her laptop.

"The drains," another voice said. "It's always the drains." A joke that had already become law.

I tore a piece of bread, spread jam on it, and took a bite. It tasted like sugar and guilt. I sipped the coffee and tried not to gag. The headache behind my eyes softened, maybe because of the caffeine, maybe because of the distraction.

My phone buzzed. A notification. A comment on my tile photo: *Are you trying to die?* I smiled. I double-tapped the heart.

After breakfast, I went back upstairs and found Jessa lacing her boots.

"You look pale," she said.

"It's the lighting," I said, and turned my face toward the window. I took a quick selfie for my story. I could see the edge of her eye roll in the reflection.

"Any plans?" she asked.

"I'm doing a morning shoot and then maybe the LX Factory," I said, rattling off the list I'd saved from a travel blog. "You?"

"I'm going to the cathedral. I want to sit in the cold and feel guilty." She grinned. Jessa's humor was dark in a way I found both funny and unsettling.

"You can have all the guilt," I said. "I have other content to make." I paused, then added, "You're welcome to join me later if you want. The tiles are insane."

She hesitated. "Maybe later. If I'm still alive." She said it like a joke, but her eyes flicked toward the stairs.

"You're obsessed with death," I said, and she laughed like she didn't care.

---

I showered in the shared bathroom on the second floor, a room that smelled like bleach and damp towels. The water was either scalding or tepid; I chose scalding because I wanted to feel something clear. Steam fogged the mirror, blurring my face until it looked like a wet thumbprint. I wiped a circle with my hand and stared at myself. My eyes were rimmed in red, mascara faintly smudged. I told myself it was the early wake-up. I told myself it was nothing.

On the way back to the dorm, I passed the reception desk. A couple stood there, the kind of couple that shared a single backpack and a mutual disdain for anything unplanned. The woman was pointing toward the kitchen, nose wrinkled.

"It smells like gas," she said, flatly.

Joana looked up from the computer. Her smile was polite and tired. "The drains," she said. "Old pipes. It happens." Her English was practiced, the same line as yesterday. The couple exchanged a look. They wanted a different answer. They didn't get one.

I walked past, trying to look like I hadn't heard. I hadn't wanted to be the kind of guest who complained. Complaining doesn't look good on camera. But the word gas lodged somewhere behind my ribs.

By late morning I was restless, the kind of restless that makes you open a cupboard just to close it. I went back down to the kitchen because I needed one more shot, a flat-lay of the table with breakfast crumbs and a soft shadow. The kitchen was busier now. A tall Australian guy leaned against the counter, shirtless, his skin already burned brown from the sun. He waved at me with a slice of toast.

"You're the tile girl," he said.

"I'm the tile girl," I agreed. I liked the shorthand. He introduced himself as Dylan. He had a lazy grin and the kind of casual beauty that made him look unbothered by everything, including the smell.

"It stinks in here," he said, as if speaking it out loud might change it.

"It's the drains," I said, because that's what we were all pretending now.

He shrugged. "If I die, bury me in those tiles." He gestured to the wall and made a mock salute. Dark humor plays well among backpackers. It also felt a little like an omen.

At the stove, a local guy with a shaved head turned a knob and cursed when the flame sputtered out. He tried again. The pilot light caught, flickered, then died. He muttered in Portuguese and switched to English for our benefit. "Back burner doesn't work," he said.

"You're not supposed to use it," Joana said from the doorway, appearing like a conscience. "Only the front, please." She held a clipboard and a half-empty roll of paper towels.

"Why?" Dylan asked.

"It's just old," Joana said, like old was a diagnosis. "It makes the smell worse." She glanced at me, then at the lighter I wasn't holding. I wasn't sure if that was in my head.

The local guy cracked a window in the courtyard door. A wedge of cool air slid in, and the smell lifted a little. The light flattened. My heart sank. I watched the shadow change on the tiles, the gold going pale. I resisted the urge to shut the door. I didn't want to be the villain in my own story.

I set my phone on the table anyway, trying to work with the new light. Dylan leaned over my shoulder and asked, "How many followers do you have?"

"A hundred and forty-two thousand," I said, and hated how proud it sounded.

"That's a lot," he said.

"It's not enough," I said, because it wasn't. Not for the bills. Not for the way my parents looked at me when I came home.

He nodded like he understood, but he didn't. He flicked crumbs off the table and offered me a piece of toast. I took it. My head had started to ache again, a band tightening. The air in the kitchen felt heavy, as if it had soaked up all the night's sleep and refused to let go.

"You look a little green," he said.

"It's just the smell," I said. "And the coffee." I smiled so he'd stop looking.

The houseplant in the corner was even deader in daylight, its leaves curled and brittle, a small brown surrender. I took a photo of it for a story about hostel life. I told myself it was for honesty. Really, I just wanted to post something different.

When I left the kitchen, my clothes carried the scent with me. It clung to my sweater, to my hair, to the back of my throat. I went upstairs, opened the window, and stuck my head out like a dog. The air outside was cold and clean and smelled like laundry and the sea. I breathed until the headache softened.

Then I put on lipstick and went out into the day.

---

The day unfolded in frames. I walked through Alfama with my phone in my hand, capturing the yellow tram grinding past an old man with a cane. I filmed a woman hanging laundry, careful not to show her face. I took a slow-motion clip of my coffee cup on a balcony, the Tagus river blurred behind it like a promise.

The light in Lisbon is a drug. It makes you feel like the world wants to be captured, like it exists to be filtered. Every corner was a backdrop. Every cobblestone was a texture. I chased it with the hunger of someone who hasn't eaten enough.

At the Miradouro de Santa Luzia, the German photographer was there again. His name was Felix. He wore a black beanie and a camera around his neck like an organ. He waved when he saw me, a small recognition that felt like a win.

"Hey, London," he said, because that was the lie I had given him yesterday.

"Hey, Berlin," I shot back. He laughed.

He took photos of me on the terrace, the river behind, my hair in the wind. He told me to look away, to look down, to look like I had a secret. I did all three. He showed me the shots on his screen. I looked good. I always did in someone else's camera.

"These will do well," he said, and I knew he meant it as a compliment and a transaction. We tagged each other, because that's what you do when you're building a brand, even if your brand is a version of yourself that doesn't exist.

We got a coffee. He talked about lens choices and light. I nodded like I understood and pretended I wasn't counting the coins in my wallet. When he went to the counter, I checked my phone. My latest post was doing okay. Not great. I watched the number tick up by ones, then stall. My stomach tightened. The algorithm is a god that requires daily sacrifice.

Felix came back with two coffees. The cups were beautiful, the coffee was thin. I took a photo of the cup and captioned it *slow mornings* while my hand shook a little from the caffeine and the sinking feeling in my chest.

"You okay?" he asked, because sometimes people see more than you want them to.

"Jet lag," I lied. "And hungry. I didn't eat breakfast. The hostel coffee is..." I made a face.

He smiled. "Eat a pastel de nata. It will cure your soul."

We shared one at a tiny bakery. It was warm and sweet and flaky. I took a bite and felt a real pleasure that had nothing to do with posting. It surprised me. I almost didn't photograph it. Almost.

By late afternoon, my phone battery was low. I sat on a bench in a square where children chased pigeons. The pigeons were fat and fearless. I opened my bank app and saw the red numbers. My chest tightened again. I had three credit cards, all nearly maxed. The next payment was due in two weeks. I had no paid collaborations lined up. The weight of it pressed against the back of my neck, a hand I couldn't shake off.

I opened Instagram. I refreshed the feed. The numbers didn't move. I scrolled. I felt a weird emptiness, a hollow behind the ribs that no latte or likes could fill.

I found my mother's last message and opened it. *Just checking in. Love you.* I held my thumb over the keyboard, then typed, *Hey. I'm okay. Lisbon is beautiful.*

The three dots appeared almost immediately. *Are you eating?*

I stared at the screen. It felt unfair that she could pierce me with four words. I typed, *Yes. I had this amazing pastry today.* I added a photo of the pastel de nata, because a picture is more soothing than honesty.

*We miss you,* she wrote. *Your dad asks about you. He worries.*

I swallowed hard. The square blurred for a second. I looked down at my hands, at the chipped nail polish, the callus from holding my phone. I wanted to call her. I wanted her to tell me it was fine, that I was doing great, that the likes would pick up, that I wasn't wasting my twenties chasing a grid.

I called anyway. She answered on the second ring, breathless like she'd been waiting.

"Hi," I said.

"Hi, love." Her voice cracked a little. It made me swallow again.

We talked about the weather, about the time difference, about trivial things. I told her about the tiles. I told her about a tram I nearly walked into. I kept my voice bright, performative. She told me my sister had started a new job. I told her I'd been working on a new series. It was all a dance around the truth.

"Are you okay?" she asked again.

"I'm fine," I said. My throat tightened. "I'm just tired. It's a lot, you know?"

There was a pause. "You could come home," she said softly.

I closed my eyes. The square was loud. The pigeons cooed. Somewhere, a guitar played a half-remembered fado tune. Home felt like failure. Home felt like relief. Home felt like a door that was closing the longer I stayed away.

"Not yet," I said. I meant it. I also didn't know if I did.

"All right," she said. She didn't push. That hurt more.

When we hung up, I sat there for a long time, the phone heavy in my hand. The hollow feeling didn't go away. It widened, like it had room to grow. I watched a group of girls take photos of each other, their smiles easy. I wondered if their smiles were real.

I walked into a public bathroom off the square, a narrow hallway of stalls that smelled like disinfectant and cheap perfume. I locked myself into a cubicle and sat on the closed lid, elbows on knees, because I didn't trust my face. I opened my app again, stared at the engagement rate like it was a lab report. It was down. A few followers had vanished. The algorithm had swallowed them without warning. A comment thread under my last reel had turned into a fight between strangers about authenticity. Someone had written *you're just like everyone else* and I had blocked them. It didn't stop me from seeing it.\n+\n+I pressed the heel of my hand into my eye until the tears that had been waiting finally slid out. It wasn't a sob, not the kind that shakes you. It was a quiet leak, a slow drip, like the building. I wiped my face with toilet paper, then opened my compact and fixed my mascara. A girl in the sink mirror next to mine was redoing her lipstick and humming. She didn't look at me. We both pretended we were fine. It felt like a ritual as old as bathrooms.\n+\n+Before I left, I took a photo of the chipped tiles in the stall, posted it as a story with a joking caption about \"Lisbon's brutalist bathrooms.\" The likes came in, tiny hearts, and I felt the panic soften just enough to breathe.\n+\n I walked back to the hostel as the sun was setting, the light turning everything honey-colored. I passed a small grocery and bought a bottle of water and a bag of chips because my stomach felt fragile, like it might eat itself. The cashier smiled. I smiled back. It was easier with strangers.

The hostel at dusk was a carousel of people. The common room hummed. Someone strummed the guitar in a way that made it sound like it was sighing. The smell from the kitchen drifted out every time the door opened, faint but persistent, like a complaint that wouldn't die.

I went up to the rooftop to film the sunset. The sky was a gradient of peach and purple. The river below reflected it in a long, bruised ribbon. The string lights blinked on, each bulb a tiny orb. I took videos, paced, narrated to my phone about Lisbon being a dream. The view was real. So was my hunger.

Jessa found me leaning against the railing. She handed me a plastic cup of wine. "You look like you need this," she said.

"I always need this," I said, and drank. The wine was warm and sour. It didn't matter.

"You okay?" she asked, because people ask that when you stop performing.

"Yeah." I didn't quite meet her eyes. "Just thinking about numbers."

"Followers?"

"Money." I said it quietly. She looked at me then, really looked.

"That's rough," she said. "Do you want to talk about it?"

The offer was gentle. It was also dangerous. I smiled and shook my head. "If I talk about it, it becomes real."

"It's real either way," she said.

I laughed, a small short sound. "You're so wise."

"I'm so tired," she said, and took a sip. We stood in silence, watching the lights blink on across the hills. The city looked like a constellation, beautiful and indifferent.

Later, back in the dorm, I lay on my bunk and scrolled through my feed. The numbers hadn't moved much. I felt the hollow again. I took a selfie in the low light, deleted it, took another, deleted that too. I posted a story of the sunset instead. Safer, less personal.

The smell from downstairs seemed stronger at night, like it rose with the moon. It pushed through the cracks in the floor. Jessa coughed in her sleep. Someone else turned over, muttering. I pulled the blanket up to my chin.

I opened the notes app and typed possible captions for tomorrow's shot. *POV: you finally found yourself.* Too basic. *Slow mornings in Lisbon.* Too boring. *This city is a dangerous kind of beautiful.* I liked that one. I starred it.

I checked the weather app. Clear skies. Sunrise at 7:12. Golden hour at 6:43. I set my alarm for 4:47 again because I liked the symmetry. My finger hovered over the slider for a second. I almost set it for later. I didn't.

From the hallway came the soft, irregular hiss of the building settling. Or maybe it wasn't the building. Maybe it was something else.

I closed my eyes and pictured the shot. Coffee cup. Tiles. Cigarette. The light like a halo. The smell of gas like a rumor. The sign on the wall like a dare.

I told myself that tomorrow I would make it perfect. I told myself that perfect was worth a little discomfort.

Downstairs, somewhere behind the stove, something breathed.
