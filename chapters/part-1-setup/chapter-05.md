# Chapter 05: The Air Isn't Photogenic

The lighter refused to light, like it knew something I didn't and was being petty about it. I flicked the wheel twice, got two sparks that died before they could become anything, and felt a ridiculous surge of irritation at an inanimate object. The kitchen was dead quiet except for the thin hiss behind the stove and the soft hum of the fridge. The smell was thick enough to taste.

I held the cigarette between my lips anyway, a cold paper stub, and smiled at my phone as if I were inhaling the dream. In the screen, I looked calm. In the room, my throat was tight. I couldn't decide if it was the air or my own stubbornness.

---

The door creaked, and my posture snapped into the smooth, blank face I practiced for cameras. Joana stepped in first, cardigan hugged around her body like armor, and behind her was Felix with his camera in his hand and a bemused look on his face.

"You're up," he said, surprised. "Again."

"It's kind of my thing," I said. I took the cigarette out of my mouth and held it like a prop, which it was. The lighter sat in my palm like a guilty coin.

Joana's eyes landed on it and then slid to the NO SMOKING sign as if she needed to remind herself it still existed. "Not inside," she said. It wasn't a reprimand. It was a plea.

"I'm not lighting it," I lied, and the lie sat in the air like the smell.

Felix looked around the kitchen, his eyes doing the slow sweep of someone who sees composition everywhere. "These tiles," he said softly, and raised his camera to catch the light. "You weren't kidding."

"Told you," I said, my voice bright. "It's like a cathedral for coffee."

"And gas," Joana murmured, almost to herself. She opened the courtyard door a few inches. The cold air slid in like a hand. The light shifted, flattening. My heart sank and then I hated myself for that sinking.

"Just for a minute," she said, and pushed the door open wider. The smell thinned. I breathed in and felt a small relief I didn't want to admit.

Felix took a few shots of the tiles, the coffee cup, my hand on the table. He moved with that confident precision that makes it look like a hobby and feel like a job. I watched him and felt both admiration and panic. His photos were always clean. Mine were always hungry.

"You want to be in it?" he asked.

"Always," I said, because the camera was pointed at me and I had to be that girl.

He had me sit at the table and angle my wrist, tilt my chin, glance down like I was thinking about a poem I'd never read. The cigarette lay beside the cup, unlit, a careful lie. I could feel Joana watching. I could feel the air around my ankles loosen with the open door. I could feel my shot turning ordinary.

"Close the door?" I asked Joana, trying to sound casual.

She hesitated, then shook her head. "Not today." Her eyes flicked to the stove, to the painted window, to the floor. The open door was her small rebellion against a building that didn't listen.

Felix clicked his shutter. "It's still good," he said, as if he could hear my disappointment. "Light is light."

"Tell that to Instagram," I said. He laughed, but it didn't make me feel better.

Joana slid toward the stove and turned a knob, then turned it back, like she was checking something she already knew. Her jaw was tight. "The back burner hasn't been right," she said to Felix, to me, to the room. "The pilot goes out. The smell gets worse."

"You should get it fixed," Felix said, because that's what people who aren't responsible for it say.

She smiled without warmth. "We told Pedro. He says it's fine." The line was so familiar it sounded rehearsed.

"He's cheap," I said, and it slipped out before I could stop it.

Joana looked at me, surprised, then nodded once. It felt like a small alliance. We didn't talk about it further. There were things that lived in the silence here.

Felix packed up, and I followed him to the courtyard. The lemon tree was glossy and green, almost offensive in its health. Felix lit his cigarette outside, the flame flicking into life easily in the open air. He took a drag and exhaled, and the smoke curled in the morning light like a ribbon. It was a perfect shot, if only the background was tiles.

"You ever smoke for real?" he asked.

"Only when I'm pretending," I said.

He squinted at me, not sure if I was joking. "Maybe you should just smoke," he said. "Then at least you're honest about it." He smiled to soften the edge.

"Honesty doesn't pay," I said, and felt the bitterness of it in my mouth. He tapped his ash and didn't argue.

I went upstairs with the smell of lemon and smoke on my clothes, and the smell of gas still in my hair.

---

By late morning, the hostel had that restless energy that makes everything feel like it's five minutes away from a party. The common room was full of laptops and espresso cups. Someone had put on a playlist of soft jazz that made everything feel like an advertisement.

I sat at the end of the table, editing Felix's photos. They were better than mine. The light was flatter, yes, but the tiles looked clean, and my face looked serene, as if I'd slept more than four hours. In one shot, the NO SMOKING sign was just barely visible in the background, half cut off. It felt like a warning and a brand deal at the same time.

My phone buzzed. A DM from Pedro: *Can you tag us today? We have a new influencer from Brazil coming tomorrow and it would be good if you post the kitchen. I'll put two free nights on your booking.*

Two nights. My chest lifted like someone had loosened a belt. I typed back *Yes of course!* before I could second-guess how fast I was selling my integrity. Integrity doesn't pay for hostels. I hit send, then opened the photo editor and cropped the NO SMOKING sign out of the frame.

Across from me, a woman rubbed her temples and pressed her knuckles into her eyes. "Does anyone else feel weird?" she asked.

"The coffee is awful," someone answered.

"It's the drains," someone else said, with the collective resignation of a joke worn thin. We had all agreed on the excuse. It was easier than admitting we were sitting in a building that smelled like a warning.

Jessa dropped into the chair next to me with a bowl of cereal. "You're up early again," she said, and then, looking at my screen, "You're also ignoring a huge red sign."

"It's art," I said. I said it like a joke. It wasn't one.

She slurped her cereal and watched me crop. "Do you ever worry you're just... making the danger look pretty?"

"That's the job," I said. It was a line. It was also true. The grid was the only proof that I existed outside of my own head.

She sighed. "I woke up with a headache," she said. "Again."

"Probably the wine," I said.

"I didn't drink last night."

I didn't know what to say. The smell from the kitchen drifted through the hallway as if to answer for me.

A new notification popped up. A comment on my last post: *This hostel looks amazing. Is it safe?* I hovered over it, then replied with a heart emoji. A heart is faster than a lie, and it looks the same.

I posted the kitchen shot with the tag, and watched the likes tick in. Pedro's account reshared it within minutes. The blue tiles became someone else's marketing tool, and I was part of the machine. The free nights felt like a reward and a bribe. I told myself I was smart for taking it. I told myself I wasn't complicit in anything real.

---

In the afternoon, Felix found me in the courtyard. He had a new roll of film and a plan to go shoot the tram in the late light. I told him yes, because saying no felt like closing a door I didn't know how to open again.

We walked through the city as the sun softened, the air smelling of grilled sardines and diesel from the trams. He talked about lenses and grain and the way light turns skin into something almost holy. I nodded and tried to pretend I understood. What I understood was the weight of his camera strap and the way he looked through the viewfinder like it was a portal to a better version of himself.

"Do you ever feel like you're chasing something that's not real?" he asked, out of nowhere.

I laughed. "Isn't that the job?"

He smiled, then looked away. "Maybe. I just... I have friends who shoot weddings. They're bored but stable. I'm here taking pictures of tiles. It feels like I'm doing something important, but it's just light and walls." He said it like a confession.

"Tiles are my brand," I said. "So if you say they're meaningless, you're insulting my entire personality."

"You have a personality?" he said, teasing.

"Only on camera," I said, and we both laughed. The laugh was genuine. It felt good to be in a moment that wasn't for an audience.

We got coffee at a tiny cafe. I took a photo of the cup, because I always do. He didn't. He just drank it.

"Don't you ever want to post?" I asked.

"I post when I have something to say," he said. "You post when you need to breathe." He didn't mean it unkindly. It still landed.

I scrolled my feed as if to prove him wrong. A new message from my mother: *Hope Lisbon is treating you well. Send pics.* I looked at her message and felt the hollow open under my ribs again. I sent her Felix's photo and a heart emoji, because a heart is faster than the truth.

We rode Tram 28 at golden hour. I stood in the doorway for a shot, hair blowing, the city spilling past like a backdrop. Felix told me to lean back, to let the wind take my hair. I did it because it would look effortless. The tram lurched and my grip slipped for a second. My stomach dropped. Felix grabbed my elbow without making a big deal of it.

"Careful," he said.

"I am careful," I lied. Careful doesn't look good on camera.

The shot was perfect. The likes would love it. The risk was a bonus.

On the walk back, my head throbbed behind my eyes. The kind of headache that makes light too bright and sound too sharp. I took two ibuprofen from my bag and swallowed them dry, because I couldn't be bothered to stop at a kiosk. Felix asked if I was okay and I said, "Yeah, just dehydrated." The word gas didn't cross my lips. It hovered there, unspoken, like the smell.

We split at the corner where the street dipped toward the river. He went one way, I went the other, the late light catching the edges of the buildings and making everything look more forgiving than it felt. I walked past a pharmacy and went in anyway, because my head was still humming and I liked the excuse of fluorescent light. The shelves were a wall of creams and cough syrups and vitamins. I picked up a tiny bottle of water and another strip of ibuprofen. The cashier rang it up with a smile that looked practiced but kind.

Outside, I leaned against the wall and took a photo of the azulejo tile sign for the farmacia. It was beautiful, of course. Everything here was beautiful if you squinted. I posted it with a caption about "Lisbon details" and watched a few hearts blink into existence. The headache eased, or maybe I just got distracted.

My phone buzzed. A text from my sister: *Mum says you're in Lisbon. Are you actually working or just taking photos of coffee again?* The message was a joke wrapped in an insult, and the familiar sting of it rose in my chest. I typed back, *Both. Lisbon is work.* I added a shot of the tram, because she can't argue with a view.

She replied with a laughing emoji and *Dad says be careful, lots of old buildings.* It was so plain and parental that it made me laugh, and then it made me swallow. I didn't want to be careful. Careful doesn't look like anything. Careful doesn't get you out of Essex.

I cut across a small square where a street performer had set up a keyboard and a tinny speaker. He played a slow version of a pop song I knew from TikTok. A few tourists dropped coins into his case. I filmed six seconds and stopped. The phone felt heavy in my hand. I dropped it into my bag and watched him play without a screen between us. The sound was worse without the filter. The moment felt raw and oddly intimate. I didn't know what to do with that, so I walked away.

At the hostel, Joana was at the desk, arguing quietly with Pedro. Their voices were low, the kind of low you use when you don't want guests to hear. I slowed on the stairs, pretended to check my phone, and listened.

"We need someone to look at it," Joana said. "It's not just the smell. The pilot goes out. People get headaches." Her words were a litany now, like she'd said them so many times they had worn a groove in her mouth.

Pedro's reply was sharp and clipped. "We cannot afford it this month. We already did the roof. We already did the tiles. People come for the tiles. Not for the pipes." He gestured toward the hallway, toward the kitchen, toward the whole point of the place. "It is fine. Everyone complains. No one leaves."

"Someone will leave," Joana said, and her voice was quiet, the kind of quiet that sounds like a warning.

"Don't be dramatic," he said, and then noticed me standing there. His smile snapped into place like a mask. "Sienna! I saw the post. It looks beautiful. The kitchen looks beautiful." He said beautiful like a spell.

"Thank you," I said, because the mask on my face matched his. We were both performing.

Joana looked at me and then away. Her eyes were tired. I wanted to say something. I didn't. I went upstairs with the sound of their argument sticking to the inside of my skull.

In the dorm, I changed into a loose sweater and sprayed my hair with dry shampoo, because my scalp felt gritty and I didn't want to waste time washing it. The smell of the kitchen clung to my clothes. I took a story of the sweater, the bed, the soft light coming through the window, and called it a "slow afternoon." Nothing about me was slow. Everything about me was a chase.

---

The hostel was louder than usual when we returned. A Brazilian group had checked in, laughing in the hallway, dragging suitcases that rattled down the stairs. The common room was full and the kitchen door kept swinging open and shut, releasing the smell like a secret that wanted attention.

I went down to the kitchen because I needed one more shot of the dinner scene for my story. The table was crowded with bowls of pasta and cheap wine. A Japanese guy I recognized from the first morning was at the stove, stirring rice. He looked exhausted, eyes half-lidded, his movements slow.

"You okay?" I asked, because he looked like he might faint.

"Headache," he said, and smiled like it was a joke. "Maybe too much walking."

"Probably," I said, and didn't mention the smell.

The gas odor was stronger here, pushed up by the heat of cooking bodies. It sat in the back of my throat, metallic and sweet. Someone opened the courtyard door and a cold slice of air cut through the room. The smell thinned. The light flattened. I watched the blue tiles lose their glow and felt a petty flare of resentment.

"Why is the window painted?" one of the Brazilian girls asked, pointing at the immovable frame.

"Aesthetic," Dylan said from the corner, grinning. "Safety is ugly." The group laughed. I laughed too, because the joke was easier than the truth.

Joana swept in with a stack of plates. "Front burners only," she said to the room, a chorus line she had performed too many times. "Please."

"Why?" someone asked, as if she might answer differently.

"Old pipes," she said. "Bad air." She opened the courtyard door wider. The light in the kitchen went dull. My phone captured it anyway.

I poured myself a glass of cheap wine and sat at the edge of the table. I lifted my phone for a story: wine, tiles, laughter. The smell hid behind the garlic and the wine and the perfume, but it was still there, a steady note under the noise. I posted the story with a caption: *family dinner, Lisbon edition.* The comments would fill with hearts. Nobody would smell the air through the screen.

Jessa slid into the chair next to me, her hair tucked into a cap. "You look pale," she said.

"It's my contour," I said, and she smiled without laughing.

"You should eat something real," she said.

"I am," I said, and pushed pasta around my plate, taking photos between bites. The pasta tasted like salt and nothing. My tongue was still numb from the coffee earlier.

Across the table, the Japanese guy's spoon clattered onto his bowl. He pressed his palm to his forehead. "It's really strong today," he said, nodding toward the stove.

"The drains," someone said, reflexive now.

"The drains are killing us," he said, but he smiled as if to make it light.

Joana looked at him, worry flickering across her face. She opened the courtyard door again. The breeze blew a napkin onto the floor. The light flattened. I looked away.

I found myself staring at the lighter in my bag, the weight of it like a coin of decision. The cigarette pack was still full, the warning label glaring: SMOKING KILLS. I had laughed at it yesterday. Tonight it felt less like a joke. I shut my bag and pushed it further under the bench, like hiding it could change anything.

---

After dinner, the common room filled with the slow chaos of people avoiding their own beds. A guy set up a chessboard on the coffee table and asked if anyone played. Two British girls argued about which filter made the tiles look more "authentic." A Danish couple sat with their laptops open, the glow turning their faces pale. The smell slid in whenever the kitchen door opened, a steady reminder that the walls were breathing something they shouldn't.

I sat on the couch and scrolled, thumb moving like a metronome. The post of the kitchen had done well. A few hundred new followers trickled in, and the spike made me feel briefly legitimate. A message from a brand I'd been chasing popped up: *Love the Lisbon content. Let's chat next week.* No promise, no money, just a maybe wrapped in optimism. I replied with a heart and a calendar emoji like I had a plan.

Across the room, a man with a shaved head was rubbing his temples, eyes squeezed shut. \"This place is giving me migraines,\" he said. His friend laughed and told him to drink water. He stood up and went toward the kitchen to refill his bottle. He came back with his eyebrows raised and said, \"It smells like gas.\"\n\n\"The drains,\" someone said, like a prayer.\n\n\"I grew up with drains,\" he said. \"They don't smell like that.\" He took a drink anyway, shoulders rising and falling in a small surrender. Nobody argued. We all knew the script.

Jessa sat on the floor with her back to the couch, stretching her legs. She looked over her shoulder at me. \"If you posted a warning,\" she said quietly, \"would people listen?\"\n\n\"They'd unfollow,\" I said, which was a joke and a fear. \"Nobody wants to see danger on a travel feed.\"\n\n\"Maybe they should,\" she said.\n\nI shrugged. \"I'm not a safety account. I'm a vibe.\" The word sounded hollow as soon as it left my mouth.

She smiled without humor. \"Vibes can still kill,\" she said, and then leaned back against the couch like she'd said too much. I wanted to be annoyed at her, but I couldn't. The truth of it sat between us like the smell.

When the chess game started, I took a photo of the board and posted it with a caption about \"slow nights in Lisbon.\" It felt like a lie. It also felt like the only way I knew how to exist in a room full of people.

Later, after the kitchen emptied and the dishes were stacked in precarious towers, I went up to the rooftop for air. The city was a field of lights, warm and indifferent. The string lights above me swayed in a faint wind. I leaned on the railing and breathed, trying to clear the smell from my hair.

Felix lit a cigarette and offered me one. I almost took it out of habit. I didn't.

"Tomorrow morning," I said instead. "I'm doing the shot. I have to."

"The one with the smoke?" he asked.

"The one with the smoke," I said.

He exhaled and watched the smoke drift toward the river. "That's a bad idea, Sienna."

"Everything is a bad idea. It just depends if it's a good photo." I said it lightly. I meant it too much.

He studied me for a moment. "You're not just a feed, you know."

"Try telling the algorithm that," I said, and looked away before he could reply.

Downstairs, someone laughed loudly. A door slammed. The hostel was alive in the way that makes you feel less alone and more lonely at the same time.

I checked my phone. The kitchen post had done well. Pedro had sent a thumbs-up emoji. The free nights were secured. The numbers on my bank app didn't look as frightening. It was a small relief. It made the rest of me feel worse.

I went down to the dorm and found Jessa sitting on her bed, reading by the light of her phone.

"You're up late," I said.

"Couldn't sleep," she said. "The smell is worse tonight."

"It comes and goes," I said.

"It shouldn't come at all," she said, and closed her book. "I saw Joana in the hallway earlier. She looked like she'd been crying."

"She's probably just tired," I said, and knew it was flimsy.

Jessa watched me like she wanted to say something else. She didn't. She pulled her blanket up and turned her phone off. The room went dark.

I lay on my bunk and scrolled through the comments. People told me I was living their dream. People asked where I got my sweater. People said the kitchen was everything. A few people asked about the smell, because they'd read the reviews. I didn't answer those.

My head still ached. I took another ibuprofen. The dorm smelled faintly of lemon cleaner and the sour edge of the gas. I closed my eyes and tried to picture something clean, something without a filter.

The shot in my head came anyway: tiles glowing, coffee steaming, smoke curling up like a ribbon. The light would be perfect at 6:43. The app said so. My alarm was already set for 4:47, because I'm nothing if not a creature of ritual.

I told myself I would open the courtyard door after the shot. I told myself I would be quick. I told myself the sign was for people who didn't understand content. I told myself that danger had never been aesthetically pleasing until I learned how to frame it.

When I drifted off, the faint hiss from below threaded through my dreams like a voice I couldn't quite make out. In the dream, the lighter finally caught, and the flame looked like a tiny sun. I reached for it, smiling, because the light was perfect.
