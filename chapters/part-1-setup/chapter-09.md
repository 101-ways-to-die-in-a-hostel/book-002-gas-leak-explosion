# Chapter 09: The Spark That Doesn't Count

By the time my alarm went off, the air already felt like someone had used it up and put it back, stale and sweet and wrong. I lay there with my phone pressed to my chest and the smell crawling under the dorm door like a cat that knew it wasn't supposed to be inside. My thumb hovered over the dismiss button. My thumb hovered over everything these days.

---

I had set the alarm for 6:40 because the light app said that was when the tiles would glow without the shadows being too honest. It was still dark in the dorm, the kind of dark that makes you forget your own face. I slid down the ladder, pulled on the matching set that looked expensive on camera, and picked up my ring light and the red lighter like they were part of the same ritual. My phone buzzed with a notification I didn't open. The kitchen buzzed with a smell I couldn't ignore.

The hallway was heavy, the air thick and damp. The building had that old-lace smell, dust and lemon cleaner, but the gas sweetness laced through it like a perfume that didn't know when to leave. I told myself the smell was just a sensory detail. I was so good at turning warnings into backdrops.

The kitchen door opened with a small sigh and the air hit me like a wet towel. It was worse than yesterday. It sat in the room and seemed to settle at ankle height, a pool of invisible something that made my eyes water. The tiles looked like a chapel in the ring light, blue and white, glittering with a kind of moral irony. The dead plant in the corner had finally collapsed. Its leaves curled inward like fists. It looked like it had been holding its breath too long.

I set up the phone on the table, angled it toward the light, placed the cup, and smoothed the tablecloth with the palm of my hand. The NO SMOKING sign glared at me, laminated and peeling, like a parent who knew I was about to lie.

The lighter felt heavy in my hand. The red plastic glowed in the ring light like a tiny alarm. I pulled a cigarette out of the pack and held it between my fingers, unlit, a prop that could become a weapon in two seconds. My caption drafted itself in my head: *The light ruins you if you let it.* That was almost true.

I clicked the lighter once, just to feel it. The spark jumped but I held it away from the cigarette, away from everything. The sound was a tiny, sharp tick that made the air feel like it flinched. I snapped it shut quickly, heart thudding, and told myself that didn't count.

A sound in the hallway made me freeze. Footsteps, soft and quick. The door pushed open and Maria stepped inside, her blue apron already damp with lemon cleaner, her kettle cord looped around her wrist. She paused when she saw me, then crossed herself anyway, as if the room required it more than I did.

"Too early," she said, shaking her head. "You never sleep. The light will take you."

"That's the plan," I said, trying to make it a joke. My voice was too bright. The smell pressed at the back of my throat.

Maria set the kettle on the counter and flicked the switch. The tiny red light came on, comforting in its electric honesty. She looked at the stove, at the painted window, at the floor. Her mouth tightened. "Bad air," she said. "Open."

She nodded toward the courtyard door. I hesitated. The light outside was too cold, too honest. The ring light could fix everything except a draft.

"Just a minute," I said. "Then I'll open it." It came out like a promise I had already broken.

Maria watched me. She didn't argue. She just opened the courtyard door herself. The cold air rushed in and sliced the smell cleanly in half. The tiles dulled, the glow gone, the shot suddenly ordinary. My heart sank for a reason I hated myself for.

"Better," she said. "You breathe."

The kettle clicked off. She poured water into a mug and held it out to me. I took it and set it on the table like it was a prop. Steam curled up and disappeared. The smell thinned but didn't leave. It waited, patient as a debt.

Maria left the door open and moved around me, wiping the counter with a practiced rhythm. I wanted to ask her why she didn't tell Pedro off, why she kept coming into this room every morning like a ritual of resignation. I didn't ask. I didn't want her answer.

When she left, I closed the courtyard door halfway. Enough to be polite, not enough to ruin my light. The air got heavy again. The smell returned like a tide.

I picked up the cigarette and held it to my lips, unlit, and pressed record. I turned my face toward the tiles, let my eyes soften, let my wrist hover above the cup. I told myself I would light the cigarette later. I told myself the smoke was the last ingredient I needed, not the first.

The hissing behind the stove was louder today. I could hear it in the pauses between my fake sips of coffee, a thin, persistent sound like a whisper that wouldn't die. I told myself it was the fridge. I told myself the fridge always hummed. I told myself anything that made me less of a person who noticed.

A new notification buzzed on my phone screen. I ignored it. The camera loved me. The air did not.

The clip looked perfect when I replayed it. The tiles glowed. The steam caught the light. The cigarette in my hand looked like a story, not a warning. I posted it without sound and added a caption about slow mornings and fast dreams. I tagged the hostel, because I was still paying rent in exposure.

The likes came in. The smell stayed.

---

By late morning the hostel was a carousel of people and cables, a loop of laptops and coffee cups and the same song playing on someone's speaker. The common room smelled like burnt coffee and sunscreen. The gas sweetness curled in every time the kitchen door opened, a reminder that the building had a secret and the secret didn't care if we were busy.

I sat at the end of the table editing my morning clip. I smoothed my skin, warmed the light, erased the open door. My pimple vanished. The tiles looked like a cathedral. The air looked invisible.

A DM popped up from Pedro. *Kitchen post looks great. Any chance you can do a cigarette shot later? It is very Lisbon.*

I stared at it, felt my throat tighten. It was both a request and a permission slip. He wasn't saying smoke inside. He was saying the shot mattered more than the rules.

I typed back, *Maybe later* and hit send. I told myself that was responsible. I told myself maybe meant no.

A woman across from me pressed her palms to her temples. "Does anyone else have a headache?" she asked, like she was breaking the fourth wall.

"Too much screen time," someone answered, and everyone laughed because it was easier than saying the word gas.

A girl with glossy black hair and a ring light bag the size of a small child slid into the chair across from me. She had eyelashes that could have their own agent and a phone that never stopped vibrating. "You're Sienna, right?" she asked. Her accent was Brazilian, soft and fast.

"Guilty," I said.

"I'm Rafa," she said, and set her phone on the table with the certainty of someone who had turned her whole life into a tripod. "Pedro asked me to find you. He says you know the angles here."

I couldn't tell if that was a compliment or a job. "The kitchen is the reason we're all here," I said.

Rafa smiled. "The tiles are insane," she said, like she was reciting a line we'd all been given. "Do you smoke?"

I hesitated. "Only for photos," I said.

She laughed. "Same. I have a whole cigarette pack that's just for reels. It's so sad, but it looks good."

"It's tragic," I said.

"We should shoot together," she said, eyes bright. "Like, a collaboration. Two girls, one morning, the light, you know?"

The idea made my chest flutter in the way it does when I imagine a post doing numbers. It also made my stomach turn. Two lighters in a room that smelled like a warning.

"Maybe," I said, and then added, "The kitchen's been weird."

"Weird?"

"Smells bad," I said. "Old pipes."

Rafa wrinkled her nose. "I smelled it last night. It was gross. But the light..." She lifted her hands in a helpless gesture. The light, again. The light was the excuse for everything.

We chatted for a few minutes about filters and brands and the kinds of captions that feel effortless. She showed me her grid, perfectly curated, pastel and bright. She asked about my engagement rate. I lied by omission. She asked about Pedro. I told her he was generous with free nights if you tagged him. She laughed like that was a joke, then looked at her phone like it was a fact.

When she left, my head felt tighter. The gas smell drifted in again when someone opened the kitchen door, and the room collectively pretended not to notice. I refreshed my feed and watched the numbers rise by two. The algorithm was a hungry god and I was feeding it breakfast.

A new comment landed under my morning post: *Girl, are you actually smoking inside? The sign says no.*

I stared at it long enough for my phone to dim. I wrote back, *No smoking, just props.* I added a laughing emoji and a sparkle. The lie tasted like metal.

My phone buzzed again. This time it was my mother. I let it go to voicemail. The guilt pooled in my chest like the gas on the kitchen floor.

In the afternoon, I escaped the hostel for air, the way you step outside a party when the music gets too loud. The city felt clean by comparison. Lisbon smelled like sea salt and grilled sardines and tram brakes, real smells with real sources. I walked downhill toward the river, phone in my hand, and let the breeze untangle the tightness in my head.

I stopped at a tiny shop that sold postcards and lighters. A rack of cheap plastic BICs stood by the register, all bright colors and little tourist logos. The old man behind the counter glanced at me and nodded.

"You smoke?" he asked, not in English but in the universal language of raised eyebrows and a tap on the lighter rack.

"For photos," I said, because apparently that's who I am now.

He snorted. "Everything for photos." He slid a pack of matches toward me. "In old buildings, use these. They are slower. You see what you are doing."

The matches were cheap cardboard, a Lisbon tram printed on the cover. I took them anyway. It felt like a concession to safety that still looked good on camera. It felt like a lie in a different font.

Outside, I walked along the river and let the wind push my hair into my face. I took a few shots of the bridge, the water, my shoes on the stones. The light was pretty but not the light I wanted. The light I wanted lived in the kitchen. The light I wanted had a smell.

I stopped at a cafe and ordered a proper espresso, the kind that didn't taste like regret. I drank it slowly, feeling my head clear. A group of tourists at the next table were talking about safety in old buildings, how charming and how dangerous. I thought about the gas detectors in the hardware store window and the way I had walked past them like they were a moral test I couldn't afford.

Felix texted me a photo. It was a shot of me from the cafe, candid, chin down, eyes a little tired. The light was gentle. The shot was honest. I stared at it and felt the urge to smooth it, to brighten it, to make it less true. I posted it anyway with a caption about Lisbon fatigue. It got fewer likes than my tile posts. Honesty doesn't trend.

On the way back, I passed the hardware store again. The gas detectors were still in the window. I stared at them for a beat, then took a photo of the tiled sign above the shop instead and posted it with a caption about "hidden details." It felt like a confession I could afford.

---

In the late afternoon, I joined one of the hostel walking tours because it was free and because free is my favorite word after "collab." A cluster of us gathered in the hallway by the reception desk, a little pack of tourists with backpacks and phone chargers dangling like IVs. The guide had a red umbrella and a voice that carried over the clatter of Tram 28. She looked like she'd seen a thousand versions of me, and she probably had.

"Lisbon is built on seven hills," she said as we started up the street, "and half of those are trying to kill you if you look at your phone while walking." A few people laughed and I laughed too, even though my stomach dipped. The first time I came here, I almost stepped into a tram for a shot. The city has a long memory.

We stopped in front of a row of tiled houses with balconies full of laundry. The guide talked about the earthquake of 1755 and the fire that followed, how the city burned for days. She pointed out soot marks on the stone of a church arch, black stains that had survived centuries. I took a photo of the soot because it was texture, because I am me. I didn't post it. It felt too close to the thing I didn't want to name.

As we climbed, my head started to throb again, a polite drumbeat behind my eyes. The air smelled like grilled sardines from a nearby restaurant and diesel from a passing tram. Real smells. Honest smells. It was a relief.

At a small square, the guide pointed to a plaque on the wall, a line of Portuguese I couldn't read. "This building was a bakery for a hundred years," she said. "There was a gas explosion here in the sixties. They rebuilt it, of course." She said it lightly, like history is a series of interesting facts rather than a warning. A couple of people nodded. I felt my stomach tighten, and I told myself it was from the uphill climb.

We went into a tiny church where the air was cool and smelled like wax. Candles flickered in little rows, offering prayers in soft light. A sign asked visitors not to light candles because the building was old and fragile. Someone lit one anyway, because rules are for guests, not believers. I snapped a photo of the flame and felt a strange tug in my chest that wasn't quite fear and wasn't quite longing.

Outside, a street musician played a mournful tune on a guitarra. The notes floated up between the buildings, soft and aching. The guide pointed out the yellow hydrants and the narrow streets and explained how fire trucks can't reach some of these alleys. "If there is a fire, you run down, not up," she said, and laughed like it was a joke. I thought about the hostel kitchen at the bottom of the hill, about the painted window and the closed door, and felt a cold little prick between my shoulder blades.

When the tour ended at a miradouro, I stayed a few minutes to film the view. The river was a sheet of hammered silver. The rooftops were terracotta, the kind that make everything look warm even when the wind is sharp. I posted a story with a heart emoji and then deleted it, because it felt like a lie. I posted it again because I needed to feel something that wasn't the headache.

On the walk back, my phone buzzed with a text from my mother. *Did you see the news?* I opened it and saw a link to a story about a kitchen fire in Porto. The headline had the word "gas" in it. My chest went tight. I told myself Porto wasn't Lisbon. I told myself gas was everywhere and that didn't mean anything. I told myself to stop reading headlines like they were about me. Then I closed the link without opening it and stuffed my phone back in my bag.

At a kiosk, I bought a bottle of water and two bananas because my body felt brittle and I needed to pretend I was taking care of it. The cashier looked at my matches when he handed me my change. He raised an eyebrow but said nothing. I felt suddenly like I had a secret too big for my pocket.

When I got back to the hostel, the hallway smelled like lemon cleaner and the same underlying sweetness. The smell seemed to cling to the walls now, like the building had absorbed it. I lingered at the reception desk, waiting for Joana, but her chair was empty and the computer screen was dark. A note taped to the monitor said BACK IN 5. I almost left a note. I almost wrote "the hissing is louder" or "the pilot went out again." I didn't. I walked upstairs with the note still blank in my head.

---

By evening, the hostel had refilled itself with noise. People clattered dishes in the kitchen. Someone played a guitar in the common room, the chords just a little off. The gas smell was thicker at night, layered under the garlic and wine like a secret no one wanted to say out loud.

I went into the kitchen to shoot with Rafa because I didn't know how to say no. She was already there, ring light set up, phone on a stack of cookbooks, her face tilted toward the tiles like she was praying to them. She had a cigarette in one hand and a cup of coffee in the other.

"Look at this light," she said, eyes wide. "It is so insane."

"It is," I said, even though the air made my eyes water.

The courtyard door was shut. The window was still painted. The smell was thick enough to taste. My head swam a little when I stepped in. I told myself it was the wine from the courtyard, even though I hadn't had any.

"Do you want to light it?" she asked, holding her lighter up.

I froze. My stomach dipped. The lighter looked like a loaded question.

"Not yet," I said quickly. "We can get the shots without it."

"But the smoke..." She pouted like the word itself was a filter.

"We can do it outside and come back in," I said, which was a plan that made no sense and also made perfect sense.

She shrugged, willing to follow any script that might make the reel better. We stepped into the courtyard, lit our cigarettes in the clean air, and watched the flames catch easily. The smoke curled around the lemon leaves. It looked perfect. It also looked like a warning label.

"Ready?" she asked.

I stubbed mine out on the concrete. The smell of burnt tobacco mixed with lemon and gas. I couldn't tell which one made me feel more sick. "Let's just do the shots," I said.

We went back inside. I didn't bring the lit cigarette. The smoke from outside was still in my hair, a faint ghost. Rafa held her cigarette unlit and we shot a quick clip, the light soft, the tiles glowing. The lighter stayed in her pocket. The air pressed in around us like a hand.

Halfway through, the stove clicked and the pilot light went out with a small sigh. The hiss from behind the stove seemed louder, as if the room had decided to speak up. Rafa paused mid-pose, eyes on the stove.

"Did you hear that?" she asked.

"Old building," I said automatically.

She looked at me. "This smells like gas, Sienna."

"Everyone says that," I said, then realized how ridiculous that sounded.

She set her cigarette down. "Maybe we should open the door?"

"It ruins the light," I said, then heard myself and felt something twist in my chest.

She opened it anyway. Cold air rushed in, the smell thinning, the light flattening. My shot died in real time. I wanted to be angry. I also wanted to breathe.

"Sorry," she said.

"No, it's fine," I said, and meant it for the first time all day.

We finished the reel with the door open. The tiles looked less holy, more real. The shot was still good. It was just not the fantasy I had been chasing. I posted it anyway, tagged Rafa, tagged the hostel, and watched the likes begin their slow climb.

Joana appeared in the doorway with a stack of plates. She looked at the open door, at us, at the stove. Her eyes softened with a gratitude that made me feel guilty. "Thank you," she said, and I wasn't sure if she meant the door or the fact that we hadn't lit anything.

"Do you want me to close it?" I asked.

"No," she said firmly. "Not tonight." She moved past us and opened the door wider. The night air slid in and the room exhaled.

I left the kitchen with my head still aching and my hands smelling faintly of smoke. The common room was louder now, the guitar player playing the same three chords like a prayer. I sat on the couch and scrolled through my comments. A few people asked about the smoke. A few people said the reel was perfect. A few people asked if the hostel was safe. I ignored those.

Someone had pinned a fresh sign by the kitchen door: NO SMOKING. It was the same wording, just a new sheet, the ink still dark. It felt like a message aimed directly at me, even though no one knew about the matches in my bag or the lighter on my pillow. I took a photo of it because irony performs well, then deleted it because I couldn't handle my own joke.

My phone buzzed with a voice note from Rafa, giddy and breathless. "We should do the cigarette shot tomorrow morning," she said. "Like, before anyone wakes up. I can bring a little ashtray. We will be so quick." I stared at the message and didn't reply. I could hear Joana's tired voice in my head, could hear Felix saying light it outside, could hear my mother asking if I was safe. I could also hear the word "viral" like a drumbeat. I closed the app. The voice note sat there, unread, like a dare.

Upstairs, the dorm was quiet. Jessa's bed was still empty. I sat on my bunk and opened my notes app, thumb hovering over a caption that said, *Some light costs more than you think.* I deleted it. Too honest. I typed instead: *Morning rituals in Lisbon.* The words felt clean and empty.

I pulled the pack of matches from my bag and set it on my pillow. The tram logo looked cute. It would look cute on camera. The red lighter sat beside it, both options, both warnings. I set my alarm for 6:43, because the light app said it would be perfect. The number felt like a countdown.

Outside the window, the city hummed. Inside, the building settled, a slow creak like a body shifting in sleep. Somewhere below, the hiss behind the stove continued, steady and patient. I closed my eyes and tried to tell myself I would not light anything tomorrow.

I didn't believe myself. I never do when the light is good.
