# Chapter 03: Borrowed Air

The alarm on my phone buzzed at 4:47 a.m. like a tiny insect trying to burrow into my skull, and the room smelled faintly of eggs and old wood and something metallic I couldn't name. I sat up in the dark, pulled my hoodie on, and told myself it was worth it because the light would be perfect and I would finally get the shot that would make Lisbon look like the dream I'd promised everyone.

Outside the window, the alley was still black, laundry hanging like sleeping bodies between buildings. Jessa's breathing was slow and even below me. The French girl in the corner had one arm flung over her eyes. I slid down the ladder and stepped around the pile of shoes, the floor cold under my bare feet, the building sighing around me.

In the hallway, the air felt thicker. It pressed at my sinuses. I made myself a quick face in the dim glow of my phone screen, smoothed my lip gloss, and watched my own eyes reflect back like small coins. I looked awake. That had to be enough.

The kitchen door creaked open and the smell hit me in a reminder that the building had other plans. It wasn't just eggs now. It was eggs and metal and a sweetness that made the back of my throat tighten. The tiles were blue even in the dim light, their patterns ghosting from the walls like a promise. I flicked on my ring light and the kitchen bloomed, the light carving out my space like a studio.

The houseplant in the corner had given up on pretending. Its leaves were curled in on themselves like fists. I moved it out of frame and told myself I was saving it the embarrassment. The sign on the wall said NO SMOKING IN KITCHEN in red, as if letters could change air.

I set my phone on the table and hit record. The empty room looked like a museum after hours. I placed a chipped cup in the frame and poured coffee from the communal pot, the stream thin and apologetic. The coffee smelled burnt and bitter. I didn't care. It was for the shot, not my stomach.

I dug in my bag for the pack of cigarettes. I was down to two. I held one between my fingers and tilted my wrist until the light hit it just right. I turned it, adjusted my elbow, imagined the caption: *Morning ritual.* I could hear the comments already. I could feel the little dopamine flicker in my chest.

My lighter was cool, smooth, familiar. I thumbed the wheel and got a click of spark and no flame. I tried again and the spark caught, a tiny blue tongue that lit the room for a breath. The smell in the air seemed to brighten. I let the flame die and told myself it was just the gas from the lighter, nothing more.

I raised the cigarette to my mouth, unlit, and took a quick series of photos with my ring light on low. My face in the screen looked serene, like a girl who knew what she was doing. My eyes in real life stung a little.

A soft noise behind me made me turn. The door opened and closed with a whisper. Maria, the cleaner, stepped in carrying her electric kettle. She froze for a moment, crossed herself, and set the kettle on the counter. Her eyes went to the stove, then to me, then to the sign. She said something in Portuguese that sounded like a prayer.

"Morning," I said, my voice too bright for the hour.

She nodded. The kettle clicked on. The tiny red light glowed, a little heart. She kept her eyes on her hands as she poured instant coffee into a mug. The air felt heavier around my ankles, as if the floor wanted to hold me down.

"Bad air," she said, in English, as if she was explaining the weather.

"Yeah," I said. I tried to laugh. "It's like, super intense this morning. But the light is insane." I gestured to the tiles like they were the reason I could breathe.

She didn't look at the tiles. "Open," she said, pointing toward the courtyard door.

I pictured the breeze slicing through the shot, flattening the light. I pictured my story with that sudden ordinary brightness, the tiles losing their glow. I shook my head. "Just five minutes," I said. "Then I can open it. Promise."

She watched me for a beat longer, then went back to her coffee. Her shoulders were stiff, her mouth a line. She took a sip and winced. The coffee was terrible and she knew it.

"No smoke," she said, more to the room than to me.

"It's just a prop," I said. I held the cigarette up like a prop in a play. It was unlit. It was harmless. It was also the thing I wanted most in the frame.

Maria shook her head, gathered her kettle, and left. The door closed behind her, and the air felt thicker without her. I watched the steam from her mug drift up and disappear, as if the kitchen swallowed it whole.

I turned back to my phone. The light was still soft, the tiles still luminous. I placed the cigarette on the saucer next to the cup, flicked my lighter open, and held it in my hand like a promise. I didn't light it. Not yet. I told myself the shot would be better with smoke. I told myself I would do it later, when the sun came up enough to make the flame a tiny star.

The sound of the building settling came from behind the stove, a faint hiss that could have been the kettle, could have been the city, could have been my imagination. I told myself it was nothing. I told myself it was old pipes and old buildings and old stories. I told myself I needed to focus.

I started a video, held the cigarette to my lips, and mimed an inhale. It felt ridiculous. It also felt right. The ritual made the morning feel like something I owned. I watched myself on screen and hated how much I liked the girl looking back.

I couldn't shake the headache. It was a faint band behind my eyes. I told myself it was the early wake-up, the coffee, the pressure to produce. It wasn't the air. It couldn't be.

A thud from the hallway made me jump. A door slammed upstairs. Footsteps came down the stairs, heavy and uneven. Dylan wandered in, shirtless again, rubbing sleep out of his eyes. He stopped when he saw me, grinned, and nodded at the setup.

"You don't sleep, do you?" he asked.

"Sleep is for people who don't have content," I said, and he laughed like he understood. He grabbed a cup and poured coffee, then took a sip and made a face.

"This stuff could strip paint," he said.

"The walls could use it," I said, gesturing at the tiles. The joke landed. He took another sip anyway.

He glanced at the stove and the floor, then at me. "Smells like someone's hiding a fart in here," he said.

"It's the drains," I said automatically.

"Ah, drains," he said, solemn, as if the drains were a political party.

He leaned against the counter, watching me shoot. He wasn't bored, exactly, but he had the bored energy of someone who had decided nothing mattered too much. "You ever just do stuff without filming it?" he asked.

I thought about it. The answer was a blank space. "I try," I said.

"You're bad at it," he said, and then smiled to take the sting out. It almost worked.

He opened the courtyard door and a slice of cold air cut through the kitchen. The smell thinned. The light flattened. My heart sank in a quiet, private way. I wanted to shut the door immediately. I didn't. That would be rude. And I had been rude enough lately.

"Fresh air," he said. "Nice."

I nodded, pretending I agreed, while my brain recalculated the lighting in the frame. The tiles went pale. My light was gone. I kept filming anyway. My brand was built on adaptability.

Joana appeared in the doorway with a clipboard and a cardigan. She took one look at the open door and relaxed a little. The relief on her face was quick and then covered, as if she hadn't meant to show it.

"Morning," she said, and then, looking at me, "You are up early again."

"Golden hour," I said. "It's a job."

She glanced at the cigarette in my hand. "No smoking. Please."

"I know," I said. "It's just for the shot. I won't light it."

She hesitated, then nodded. Her gaze went to the stove. The back burner knob was turned off, but her eyes still flicked there, quick as a twitch. She scribbled something on her clipboard. The sound of pen on paper felt sharp in the quiet.

"We had a complaint last night," she said, like she was telling me about the weather. "About the smell."

"Yeah," Dylan said. "I smelled it too."

Joana shrugged, a small exhausted motion. "Old pipes," she said, reciting the line. "We will have someone look soon."

Her eyes met mine for half a second. Something passed between us. A warning. A resignation. A request for me not to make her life harder. I nodded like I understood. I didn't.

I finished my shots, dropped the cigarette back into my bag, and turned off the ring light. The kitchen went dim and ordinary. The tiles were still beautiful, but not deadly. I packed up and let Dylan keep the door open a little longer, even though my shot had already suffered.

When I left the kitchen, the air in the hallway felt cleaner. I inhaled like I had been underwater. I took my phone out and checked the footage. It was good. It wasn't perfect. I told myself I'd redo it tomorrow. Perfect was always one morning away.

By noon, the hostel had filled with the sound of people being awake. The common room was crowded with laptops and coffee cups, with power adapters tangled like vines. I sat at the end of the big table and edited my morning shots, adjusting the highlights until the tiles looked like they were lit from within.

A girl across from me was on a video call, her voice too loud. She was telling someone about the smell in the kitchen, rolling her eyes, calling it "gross." A guy beside her kept rubbing his temples. He had a red imprint on his forehead from a sleep mask. He said, "It's giving me a headache," and she didn't hear him because she was telling her friend about the tiles.

Jessa dropped into the chair next to me. She had a coffee in a paper cup and a crumb stuck to her cheek. She looked at my phone screen and whistled softly. "You make everything look like a movie," she said.

"That's the idea," I said.

"Even the gas?" she asked, deadpan. Her eyes flicked to the kitchen door.

"The gas can't be photographed," I said. "So it doesn't exist."

She laughed, but it was a short laugh. "That's not how gas works," she said.

"That's how Instagram works," I said, and we both knew which one I listened to.

She sipped her coffee and made a face. "This stuff could strip paint," she said, echoing Dylan.

"Lisbon is just bad at breakfast," I said. It wasn't fair to Lisbon, but it sounded good.

Jessa leaned back and watched people walk past the reception desk. She was quiet for a minute, her eyes following Joana as she carried a stack of fresh towels. "That girl looks tired," she said.

"Everyone here looks tired," I said. "We all pretend we aren't."

"That's your brand," she said, and smiled.

I checked my feed. The post from yesterday had stopped moving. The numbers sat there, stubborn. I refreshed anyway. Nothing. I opened my DMs. A brand with a tiny following had messaged me about a gifted collab for a hotel robe. Gifted meant no money. I told myself to answer later.

A notification popped up from Felix. He had sent me the photos from yesterday with a simple message: *Use whatever you want.* The photos were good. They were the kind of good that made me want to post them immediately. I was going to. I just needed a caption that sounded effortless.

"I'm going out," Jessa said. "Want to come?"

"Where?"

"There's a flea market by the river," she said. "Old maps, weird trinkets, stolen silver."

"I have to edit," I said, and then, because I didn't want to seem like the kind of girl who never said yes, "Maybe later."

"You should go outside," she said. "The air in here is bad."

"It's fine," I said. "It's just the drains."

"You know that's what everyone says right before something awful happens," she said.

"You're obsessed with death," I said, and she smiled like she'd been called out for being too honest.

I stayed inside. The common room smelled like coffee and deodorant and the faint egg smell that had become the hostel's signature. I put my headphones on and edited. I watched myself in the kitchen, cigarettes and tiles and my own face, a girl who looked like she was living a dream. My headache threaded itself through the noise. I took an ibuprofen and told myself I needed to eat something real.

Around three, I went to a cafe down the street because I wanted a proper espresso for my morning shot. The cafe was tiny and bright, with real light, a counter of pastel de nata, and a barista who made a heart in the foam without trying. I filmed the coffee anyway, a little flourish with my wrist. The barista watched me with a neutral expression. He had seen me before. He would see me again. He made me feel ordinary and I hated it.

I bought a pack of Portuguese cigarettes at the corner shop on the way back, because the pack I had was soft from my bag and the branding was wrong for the shot. The new pack had a warning label with a diseased lung. It was ugly. I tucked it into a side pocket in my bag, out of frame. The cigarettes smelled sharper, like they were fresher, more honest. I told myself it was for authenticity.

When I got back to the hostel, Joana was arguing quietly with a man in a linen shirt. He had the kind of body that comes from private gyms and resentment. He gestured toward the kitchen, his voice low and irritated. Joana's shoulders were tight. She caught my eye for a second and looked away.

I dropped my bag in the dorm and changed into a linen set that made me look like I belonged on a brochure. I went down to the courtyard and sat under the lemon tree, the leaves glossy, the smell bright and clean. I breathed deeply and felt my chest loosen. I posted a story about the lemon tree because it felt like a good contrast to the tiles. The hostel, in my feed, looked like a dream. It was easier to make it look like a dream than to admit it felt like a slow leak.

As the afternoon slid into evening, the hostel came alive. People came back sunburned and buzzing. Music started in the common room, tinny from a Bluetooth speaker. Someone mixed sangria in a plastic pitcher. I hovered in the doorway of my dorm and debated whether to go to the rooftop. I wanted the sunset. I wanted the content. I wanted to be seen.

I went up.

The terrace was crowded, the string lights not yet on. The river was a strip of silver in the distance. I took videos of the skyline, the rooftops stacked like terracotta scales. I turned the camera on myself and talked about Lisbon being a dream, about how you could feel history in the stones. I believed it while I said it. That's the trick.

Felix texted me asking if I wanted to meet later for a night shot. I told him maybe. I told him I had to get up early for sunrise, because that was true. He sent a thumbs-up emoji. We were all communicating in symbols now.

Dylan sat on the railing with his legs dangling over the edge. He handed me a plastic cup of sangria. "To Lisbon," he said. We clinked. The sangria was too sweet. I drank it anyway.

"You seem tired," he said.

"I'm always tired," I said. "It's part of the aesthetic."

He laughed. "That's depressing."

"That's funny," I said.

We watched the sunset without speaking. For a few minutes, the city looked like it was on fire in a good way. The sky went orange, then pink, then a bruised purple. Everyone held their phones up to capture it. I did too. It felt like we were all part of the same ritual, the same worship.

After the sun dipped, a hunger swept over the terrace like a tide. Someone said there was pasta downstairs. Dylan hopped off the railing and stretched, his back cracking. I followed him down, phone in hand, because food and kitchen tiles were both content.

The kitchen was crowded, steamy, loud with clinking pots and laughter. The smell was worse when there were bodies in the room, heat lifting it off the floor. It sat under the scent of garlic and onions like a secret. A guy with a man bun stood at the stove, stirring a pot with the cautious look of someone defusing a bomb. The back burner sat unused, a dark eye.

"Can you turn the flame up?" a girl asked in Spanish, fanning her face. The man bun guy reached for the knob, hesitated, and then turned it anyway. The pilot light did nothing. He frowned, then clicked the starter again. The blue flame flared, sputtered, died. He tried once more. A soft whoof of fire bloomed, quick and bright, licking up the side of the pot before settling into a steady flame. Everyone laughed a little too loudly, a chorus of nerves disguised as humor.

"See? It works," he said.

"It shouldn't," Joana said from the doorway. She was carrying a stack of plates and looked like she wanted to throw them. "Only the front burners. Please."

"It is the front," he said, gesturing at the knob, confused.

"Then you are too close to the back," she said, and pointed, her jaw tight. "Don't use that one."

He raised his hands in surrender, turned the knob down, and slid the pot forward. Joana exhaled through her nose, a thin line of air. She opened the courtyard door and cold air rushed in, flattening the light and the smell at the same time.

"Why is the window painted?" someone asked, pointing at the immovable frame.

"Because it looks better in photos," Dylan said, deadpan, and a few people laughed. I did too, even though it wasn't a joke.

I took a slow video of the pot bubbling, the steam rising against the tile. The flare from before replayed in my head, a brief burst of light like a camera flash. It had been nothing. It had been something. I put a laughing emoji on my story draft and didn't post it.

The smell lingered even with the door open. It sat on my tongue, metallic and sweet. A woman at the table rubbed her temples and said, "This is giving me a headache." Her friend shrugged and said, "It's the drains," as if drains were a personality trait.

I made a plate of pasta and took three photos before I ate it. The first bite was too hot. I burned my tongue and couldn't taste much after. It didn't matter. The shot was good.

When I left the kitchen, Joana's eyes followed me. I couldn't tell if she was annoyed or worried. I smiled anyway. Smiling is the easiest way to keep people from asking questions.

When I posted the sunset, the likes came quickly. My chest lifted. It wasn't a lot, but it was something. The algorithm had thrown me a bone. I told myself the world was listening.

Later, when the terrace emptied, I went back downstairs and found Jessa in the common room playing cards with a group of French guys. She waved me over. I joined, even though I didn't know the rules. The game was an excuse to talk, to laugh, to be in a room with people without having to perform.

They asked about my job. I said "content creator" with a shrug and watched them decide what to think of it. One of them said he was a software engineer. He looked embarrassed about it. We were all embarrassed about something.

The kitchen door opened and the smell crept into the room like a shy guest. A chorus of groans went up.

"Not again," one of the French guys said. He stood up and went to the kitchen, shouting something in French as he went. A moment later, the courtyard door banged open and cold air rushed in. The smell thinned. The lights in the common room flickered for a second. Nobody commented on that. We went back to our cards.

At midnight, I went upstairs and lay on my bunk. My hair smelled like smoke from the rooftop cigarettes. My clothes smelled like the kitchen. My phone was at twenty percent. I plugged it in and scrolled through the shots I hadn't posted. There were dozens. I felt like I was drowning in my own content.

I opened the new pack of cigarettes and looked at the warning label. The lung was black and shiny. The words said SMOKING KILLS. I laughed quietly. It felt like a joke aimed at someone else.

I set my alarm for 4:47 again, because routine is a kind of safety. I typed a caption in my notes: *POV: you finally found yourself.* I deleted it. I typed: *This city is a dangerous kind of beautiful.* I kept that one. It felt truer than it should have.

Before I turned the light off, I checked the weather one more time. Clear skies. No wind. The light would be perfect.

I lay on my back and listened to the building breathe. There was a faint hiss from below, soft and constant, like someone running a tap in another room. I told myself it was the pipes. I told myself the building was old. I told myself I would be quick in the morning.

In the dark, I could almost smell the kitchen. It was faint, like a memory. I closed my eyes and pictured the shot one more time. Coffee cup. Tiles. Cigarette. The light like a promise. My thumb on the wheel of the lighter, the spark ready.

I fell asleep thinking about that tiny flame.

---

I woke at 4:43, before the alarm. That should have felt like a sign. It felt like ambition.

The dorm was a blue shadow. I slid out of bed, pulled on my hoodie, and checked my phone for notifications. A few new likes. A comment on my sunset. *You live the dream.* I smiled. The comment felt like a prayer.

I crept down the stairs. The hallway smelled stronger than it had yesterday. I paused at the kitchen door with my hand on the handle, took a breath, and opened it.

The air inside was warm and thick. The smell hit me like a wet towel. It made my eyes water. For a second, I hesitated. I thought about opening the courtyard door. I thought about the light. I thought about the caption. I thought about my bank balance. I stepped inside and shut the door behind me.

The tiles caught the first hint of dawn and glowed like they were lit from within. I turned on my ring light anyway, because control is comfort. I set up my phone, placed the cup, arranged the cigarette packet just out of frame. My new pack was crisp, the logo clean. I pulled out a fresh cigarette and held it like a pen.

My head throbbed faintly. I took another breath. The air tasted sweet and bitter at once, like rotting fruit. I told myself it was my nerves. I told myself I was fine.

I hit record.

In the quiet, the hiss from behind the stove sounded louder. I told myself it was the fridge. I told myself the fridge always hummed. I adjusted the focus and smiled at myself. The camera loved me. The camera never complained about the air.

I lifted the lighter. The metal was cold. My thumb found the wheel, familiar and smooth. I looked at the NO SMOKING sign, then at my own face on the screen, then back at the lighter. The rule felt far away. The light was perfect.

I took a breath, held the cigarette to my lips, and pressed my thumb to the wheel.
