# Chapter 01: The Light in Here Is Criminal

The tram screamed around the corner like an animal being dragged, and I nearly walked straight into it because the light on the tiles across the street was a crime scene. The morning had that Lisbon gold that makes everyone look like they're starring in a travel ad, and the azulejos on the building opposite had swallowed it and thrown it back as a grid of blue fire. I lifted my phone without thinking, framed the shot, took three steps into the street, and a hand yanked me backward by my jacket.

"Are you trying to die?" a voice said in English that sounded practiced.

I blinked. A tourist guide. A woman with a red umbrella, chin strap on, eyes sharp. She released me like I was a mistake she didn't want to own. The tram went past, the wind snatched my hair, and my heart did a flutter that wasn't fear so much as adrenaline on the verge of applause.

"Sorry," I said, smiling like an apology could be a currency. "The light." I pointed at the tiles as if they were my defense.

She stared at me like she had seen ten of me already today. "The light is here even when you are dead," she said, and her umbrella spun as she turned to herd a line of retirees toward the hill.

I laughed, because it was funny, and also because it wasn't. I posted the shot anyway. The caption wrote itself in my head before I hit upload: *This city is literally trying to kill me and I'm obsessed.*

I was ten minutes late to check-in because I had to get the shot, and then I had to adjust the highlight curve, and then I had to wait for the signal bar to crawl out of the dead zone between buildings. The hostel was four minutes away if you walk like a person who has a destination. It was twelve if you are staging an origin story.

Casa dos Azulejos sat on a narrow street that sloped up like a shrug. The facade was all blue-and-white tiles and wrought iron, charming and overexposed in real life. The door was heavy, with a brass handle polished by a thousand hands. I pressed my palm flat on it for a story. The wood felt cool, a tactile moment. I told myself it would make good B-roll.

Inside, it smelled like old wood, coffee, and lemon cleaner. There was another smell underneath that, sharp and wrong, like a boiled egg left out in the sun. I noticed it and filed it under *old building* because I wasn't here to be difficult. I rang a bell that looked antique enough to have been stolen from a church.

"Bom dia," said a woman from behind the desk, voice warm. She had a glossy braid and an expression that was mostly tired with a polite veneer. "Passport, please."

I handed it over and gave my best impression of a girl who loves life instead of a girl who loves approval. "Hi. I'm Sienna. Check-in for two nights."

She typed on a computer that looked older than me. "Sienna... Blackwood?"

"Yes." I brightened the name. There is something about giving someone your real surname that feels like showing a scar.

"We take deposit. Cash or card."

I swiped a card with a chip that had started to look thin. She didn't look at the name, only at the receipt. Behind her, a sign said "NO SMOKING INSIDE" in English and Portuguese, in red, in three sizes of font. I told myself it was part of the aesthetic.

She slid a keycard toward me. "Room Alfama, second floor. Female dorm. Breakfast is simple. No eggs. The kitchen has rules."

"No eggs?" I smiled because it felt like the right response.

She gestured to a sheet on the counter. Rules in six languages, all caps. No outside guests after midnight. No noise after 11. Clean your dishes. *No smoking inside.*

"It is old," she said, as if reading my face. "We ask that you only use the front burners. The back burner is... not good." She said it like it was a temperament issue. "And if you smell gas, tell me."

"Gas?" I said, but the word came out as a question I didn't intend to ask.

"Old pipes. Sometimes there is a smell. The window helps. It's fine." She smiled so quickly it felt automatic. "Welcome."

She handed back my passport and a map with tour times printed on the back. I snapped a photo of the map for a story, because maps always play well, even when you use Google like everyone else.

The stairs were steep and polished by time. The walls were seafoam, the kind of color you buy when you want to feel calm. Posters advertised rooftop yoga and a walking tour that promised to be "authentic." My carry-on rumbled behind me. It probably weighed more than the morality of my lifestyle, but it fit in the overhead bin, and that is what matters.

The dorm door creaked. Six beds, three bunks, all white metal and scuffed wood. A window opened to an alley where laundry hung between buildings like flags. The light in the room was flat, but the light outside was perfect. I was already plotting.

There were two other women. One with shaved hair sat cross-legged on a lower bunk, threading a needle through a tear in her backpack. She looked up and smiled. It was warm, unfiltered, and almost knocked me sideways.

"Hey," she said. "I'm Jessa. You in the top?"

"Yeah." I dropped my bag and tried to look effortless. "I'm Sienna."

"Nice." She nodded toward the empty bunk above hers. "I sleepwalk sometimes. Don't be scared if I stand at the end of your bed like a Victorian ghost."

"That's totally fine," I said, because saying anything else would have been strange. She went back to her sewing like she hadn't just dropped a horror movie into the conversation.

The other woman lay on her bed with a book. She had a ponytail and a face that said she could run a marathon without training. She glanced at me, nodded once, and returned to her page. I pretended I didn't see her. She pretended the same.

I chose the bunk by the window because it had the best light. I opened the window, angled my phone, and shot a thirty-second pan of the alley. Laundry flapping, blue tiles, a dog barking below. I added a filter to make the whites creamy, the blues deeper. The shot was almost enough to pretend I belonged here for reasons other than content.

When I turned back into the room, the smell from downstairs had followed me. It clung to my clothes like a stubborn acquaintance. I wrinkled my nose and pulled out a travel-size perfume, spritzed the air, filmed that, too. *Travel hack: always pack a scent you love.* I already knew the comments would say things like "queen" and "iconic" and I would pretend I didn't need them.

I unpacked with one hand while scrolling with the other. The grid, the story ideas, the DM from my mother that I hadn't answered. *Are you safe?* I hovered over the message and closed it. Safe is a word I like when it comes with a soft bed and a label. Safe doesn't pay for the next flight.

I changed into a matching linen set that looked expensive in photos and cheap in my bank account. I hooked my hair into a claw clip and went to find the famous kitchen. The tiles were the whole reason I booked this place. When you say "Casa dos Azulejos" on Instagram, you get a certain kind of response.

The kitchen was on the ground floor, past the common room, past a little courtyard with a lemon tree. The lemon tree smelled good in a way the rest of the building didn't. The kitchen door swung open and there it was: blue-and-white azulejos from floor to ceiling, a long wooden table in the middle, old gas stove against the wall, a small window painted shut. The light hit the tiles and turned them into a kind of fever dream. I lifted my phone and started shooting.

There was a houseplant on a shelf, brown and drooping like it had been punished. There was a sign on the wall: *NO SMOKING IN KITCHEN.* The sign was laminated and had a coffee stain. I framed it out of the shot.

Two people were making breakfast. A Japanese guy was stirring rice in a pot, and a Brazilian guy leaned against the counter, drinking water. They nodded at me the way people do when they are too tired to be social. I nodded back, set my phone on a coffee cup for a time-lapse, and moved the salt shaker into frame because it was white.

"Morning," I said.

"Morning," said the Brazilian guy. He fanned the air in front of his face. "It smells weird here, huh?"

"It's the drains," I said automatically, because that was what the front desk had said. It was easier to repeat a line than to form a new thought.

He shrugged. "Old building."

I turned toward the stove. The knobs were smooth, the numbers rubbed away by hands that had cooked and left and been forgotten. There was a faint hiss behind the stove, just enough to be confused with the soundtrack of the hostel. I told myself it was the espresso machine in the common room. I told myself a lot of things.

The smell was stronger here. Rotten egg, metal, something faintly sweet. It hit the back of my throat. I pulled the sleeve of my shirt over my mouth because it looked like a candid shot of a girl who cares about the environment. I took a picture anyway, because the light was criminal.

The Japanese guy stirred his rice and glanced toward the back of the stove. "The pilot light goes out sometimes," he said, more to himself than to me. "Yesterday, it was out, and the air was heavy." He made a face, then smiled like he was embarrassed for bringing it up.

"That's super concerning," I said, and I meant it, and then I added, "But this tile is everything."

He didn't know how to respond, so he didn't. I moved my phone closer to the wall to catch the glint on the glaze. I imagined the reel: slow pans, soft music, text overlay: *European slow mornings.* I imagined the comments.

A woman with a braid walked in. The receptionist. She flicked the window latch and frowned when it didn't move. "The window is painted," she said, and then she shrugged like the window had a personality.

"Should we, like, open a door?" the Brazilian guy asked.

"If it bothers you, open the courtyard door," she said. "But it will ruin the light for the photos." She looked at me and her mouth twitched like she was trying not to smile.

"I can work with it," I said, because I always can. I put on my ring light and aimed it at the tiles. The difference between bad and good light is the difference between a sponsored trip and an empty bank account. I wasn't going to risk it for air.

I shot a quick video of me pouring coffee into a cup I didn't intend to drink. The coffee smelled burnt and the cup was chipped, which I held at a angle that hid it. I pulled my lighter out of my bag to place it in the frame, a prop for the later shot. I didn't light it. Not yet. I would do that later, when the light was perfect, when the shot would justify it.

By noon, I had filled my story with the kitchen and the courtyard and the tile detail shots. I went back upstairs and found Jessa sitting with her feet on the bunk, a notebook in her lap.

"You look like you've been in a museum," she said.

"The kitchen here is insane," I said. "It's like a tile cathedral."

"Does it smell like death in there?" she asked, deadpan.

I laughed. "It smells like eggs that have been emotionally neglected."

"I told the receptionist," she said. "She said it's fine."

"Everything is fine until it isn't." I said it like a joke because that's how I do truth.

Jessa watched me for a beat. "Do you actually like traveling?" she asked.

It was an odd question, the kind you ask if you haven't been online too much. I tried to find the right answer in my head, the right version of myself. The one who is adventurous, who loves culture, who isn't just running from her parents' disappointment and a life that felt too small.

"I like how it looks," I said. "I like that it makes me feel like I'm someone who does things."

She nodded like that made sense. "I like how it smells," she said. "Not this place. Other places."

"This place smells like..." I waved my hand.

"Death," she said, and grinned.

We went out for lunch. I took photos of the pastel de nata and only ate half because the shot was better than the taste, and also because my stomach had been off since the kitchen. I told myself it was the humidity. Lisbon air does that, everyone says.

We walked through the Alfama, up hills and down stairs that tilted like the world wasn't level. There were cats and fado music and the sound of trams. I filmed a slow-motion clip of my boots on cobblestone, and then I ran the clip back and realized I had nearly twisted my ankle because I wasn't looking down. It was fine. The footage was worth it.

At a viewpoint, a German photographer offered to take a photo of me. He was handsome in a rugged way, but mostly I liked that he held the camera like he knew what he was doing. He took six shots. I took his Instagram handle in return. He had twenty thousand followers and a smirk. We both understood the exchange.

When I posted the photo, the likes came faster than usual, and I felt the little lift in my chest that keeps me going. The quiet fear about gas in a kitchen dissolved a little. My body is very obedient to attention.

By evening, the hostel was a different creature. The common room filled with voices and laughter and the clatter of bottles. The courtyard smelled like citrus and smoke. People came and went to the rooftop, balancing drinks and phones, the string lights casting a soft glow on their faces. It could have been any hostel in any city, but there was a particular buzz here, a sense that this place had been discovered and was now being consumed.

I set up my phone on a windowsill in the common room and filmed myself laughing at something no one had said. I was good at that. The bartender poured me a warm beer and I smiled as if it was the best thing I'd had all day. Jessa found me and we clinked bottles.

"I met a photographer today," I said. "He said he could help me get some shots."

"Does he have a girlfriend?" she asked.

"It doesn't matter," I said, and then realized how that sounded. "For the photos."

She rolled her eyes and took a sip. "You and your photos."

"It's my job," I said, and immediately regretted the word job, because it felt like a lie. I was unemployed with a feed.

The smell in the common room was faint but there, like a memory. I smelled it every time the door to the kitchen opened. People joked about it. Someone called it the "hostel egg perfume." Someone else said it was the drains. I nodded along, because nodding was easier than stepping into the role of concern.

Later, I went down to the kitchen again because the light at dusk is a drug. The tiles glowed, the table was empty, the window was still painted shut. I set up my tripod and ring light and started a slow pan, imagining the reel: me in a loose sweater, coffee in hand, cigarette between fingers, the caption about finding yourself in Europe. It was ridiculous. It was perfect.

The kitchen smelled stronger at night. The air felt heavy, like it had been sleeping on the floor. I wrinkled my nose, opened the courtyard door for a minute, and then closed it because the breeze softened the light. I told myself I had done the responsible thing. I told myself a lot.

I took a selfie with the tiles behind me. My skin looked too shiny, so I adjusted the exposure and saw my reflection in the glass of the microwave: a girl with glossy hair, lip filler, and eyes that were both sharp and tired. For a moment, the reflection looked like a stranger. I took the shot anyway.

A sign on the wall caught my eye. *NO SMOKING IN KITCHEN.* The letters were bold. I took a photo of the sign, because irony plays well online.

"You're going to get in trouble," a voice said from the doorway.

I turned. The receptionist stood there, her braid falling over one shoulder. She had a dish towel in her hand.

"It's a sign," I said. "Like, the irony is the point."

"People will ignore it," she said, and then she looked past me to the stove. Her eyes flicked to the back burner, to the wall, to the floor, a quick sweep. She knew something. She was choosing not to say it.

"Does it really smell like gas?" I asked, because the question had been growing in me all day, like a bruise.

She hesitated. "The building is old. The pipes are old. The owner says we don't need to worry. He says it is in the walls." She lifted a shoulder in a shrug that could have been anything: resignation, exhaustion, a warning. "Please, if you feel dizzy, go outside."

"I'm fine," I said, because that is what I always say. I wasn't dizzy. I was just hungry and a little lightheaded from not eating much. The signs were all there, and I read none of them.

"Good," she said, and then she smiled like she was sad. "The tiles are beautiful, yes?"

"They are everything," I said.

She nodded. "That is why we survive." Then she left, and the kitchen was mine again.

I posted a story with the tiles and a caption: *No smoking sign but the light is too good. Lisbon, you're toxic.* People laughed. I felt seen. I felt a tightness in my chest that I blamed on the beer.

Back upstairs, Jessa was lying on her bed, scrolling. She showed me a photo of a cat she'd taken in the alley. "He followed me," she said. "Like he wanted to warn me."

"About what?" I asked.

"This place," she said.

I laughed. "You are obsessed with death." I meant it as a joke, but she didn't laugh.

"No," she said. "I'm obsessed with living." She pulled her hoodie over her knees. "Sometimes you have to be aware of the ways you can die to figure out what you're doing here."

I opened my mouth and then closed it. Jessa was on a different frequency. I liked her, but I didn't know how to talk to her about that frequency. Mine was curated. Hers was raw.

I lay on my bunk and opened my phone. Messages, likes, a new follower from Germany. My mother texted again: *Just checking in. Love you.* I stared at it, felt a small ache under my ribs, and wrote, *I'm good, don't worry.* It was mostly true. I am always good, until I am not.

I scrolled through my own feed, as if seeing it from the outside would tell me something. It was a parade of sunlit places and my own face in different lighting. It was a record of a life that looked perfect from a distance. It was a life I had to keep maintaining because I didn't know what else to do.

The smell of gas drifted up the stairs like a ghost trying to make itself known. The fan in the dorm clicked. Someone coughed in their sleep. I closed my eyes and imagined the kitchen in the morning, the way the light would fall on the tiles, the way the coffee steam would rise. The shot in my head had a cigarette in it. It always did. The cigarette was the punctuation, the little dash of European cool. The cigarette was an old idea I kept dressing up in new cities.

I had quit smoking years ago, mostly, but I always kept a pack for photos. The cigarettes went stale in my bag and I never cared. When I wanted the shot, I lit one, took a photo, and let it burn between my fingers like a prop.

I thought about the sign in the kitchen, about the receptionist's shrug, about the smell. I thought about the houseplant drooping on the shelf like it had been punished for breathing.

The thought came, quiet as a notification: *Maybe do it outside.*

I dismissed it. Outside, the light was wrong. Outside, there were people. Outside, the tiles didn't exist. I needed the tiles. The tiles were the reason I booked this place. The tiles were the difference between an okay post and a perfect one.

By midnight, the dorm was quiet. The French girl had turned off her light. Jessa had put on an eye mask. I could hear the faint hum of the building, the settling of old wood, the distant clatter of someone washing dishes downstairs. My phone was face down on my chest. I could still feel the faint itch of the day's comments.

I drifted off thinking about the morning. I saw the shot in my head: me at the table, coffee cup in hand, cigarette between fingers, the tiles behind me like a halo. The light would be perfect at 6:40, according to the app I'd downloaded. I would set my alarm for 4:47. I'd do my makeup quietly. I'd slip downstairs before anyone else. I'd get the shot. I'd post it by 7. I'd watch the likes roll in like tide.

The smell was stronger than earlier. It slid under the door, thick and warm. I told myself it was the cleaning product. I told myself it was the drains. I told myself I had no choice but to accept a little discomfort in exchange for a perfect frame.

At 2 a.m., I woke to the sound of someone in the hall. A door creaked. A laugh. I drifted back to sleep thinking about my caption: *POV: you found yourself in Lisbon.* I should change it. It was too used. It didn't matter. It always worked.

By 4:30, my alarm vibrated under my pillow. I sat up, careful not to wake Jessa, and felt the room spin for a second. I blamed it on sleep. I sat still until the spin stopped. I pulled on leggings and a sweater. I did my makeup in the dark with the phone flashlight, the mirror in my hand. I drew my eyebrows in with a precision that felt like control.

The hallway was cold. The stairs creaked. The common room was empty, the guitars silent. I stepped into the kitchen, and the smell hit me like a wall. It was worse. It was so strong it made my eyes water. I held my sleeve over my nose and laughed under my breath. "European plumbing," I whispered, mocking myself.

The tiles were lit from the east-facing window, and they looked like stained glass. The light was perfect. I set up my phone on the table, ring light ready, coffee cup placed at the exact angle. I adjusted the frame three times. The houseplant drooped in the corner like a dying witness. I ignored it.

My stomach felt hollow. My head had a slight pulse. I told myself I hadn't eaten. I told myself I'd fix it after the shot. The gas smell was thick, almost sweet now, like rotting fruit. I gagged a little, then smiled because the camera was on.

"Good morning, Lisbon," I whispered, and hit record.

I reached into my bag for the cigarette.

The lighter was cool in my palm.

My thumb rested on the wheel.

Outside, the city was waking up. The tram clattered in the distance. A gull cried. The tiles glowed. The sign on the wall said *NO SMOKING IN KITCHEN.*

I exhaled, framed my face, and smiled at myself.
