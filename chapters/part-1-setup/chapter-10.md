# Chapter 10: The Light That Bites

The night I decided to set a real alarm for a fake cigarette, the building clicked like it was chewing something it couldn't swallow. Not a big sound, not a dramatic movie crack—just a small, metallic tick, like a stove knob being turned by a hand you couldn't see. I lay on my bunk with the sheet pulled to my chin and listened to the hostel breathe, the old wood settling, the pipes whispering, the faint hiss that never fully went away. It sounded like the building was practicing a secret.

I looked at the red lighter on my pillow and felt my thumb twitch toward it. It was ridiculous. It was a prop. It was a tiny object that had somehow become the center of my day.

I didn't light it. I set my alarm instead.

---

By morning, the hostel had refilled itself with voices and coffee and the familiar smell of everything being slightly off. The common room was a collage of backpacks and bare feet, phone cords snaking across the floor like roots. Someone had stuck a fresh bunch of postcards on the board by reception. The tiles on them were the same tiles downstairs, the same blue and white dream the hostel sold, the same reason I'd chosen this place over a clean, boring hotel with smoke detectors and windows that opened.

I took my coffee outside to the courtyard because the air inside felt thick enough to chew. The lemon tree shimmered with dew, leaves glossy and perfect. I aimed my phone toward it, took a story, and wrote *morning reset* even though I was already behind.

Rafa showed up in the doorway with her ring light bag slung over her shoulder. She wore sunglasses even though it was barely nine, which made her look more awake than me and less honest.

"You heard my voice note?" she asked.

I smiled the way I do in DMs. "I did. I fell asleep." That wasn't exactly a lie. I had fallen asleep with her message still open, the little blue orb of her voice waiting.

"Tomorrow morning," she said, sitting across from me like it was already a scheduled shoot. "We'll be fast. No one will notice." She tapped her phone, pulled up a draft clip of last night, the two of us in the kitchen, the tiles glowing, our unlit cigarettes like punctuation.

I watched it and felt my stomach drop and lift at the same time. The shot was good. It was more than good. It was the kind of good that makes you think you're immune to consequences.

"The light is perfect at like six-forty," she said. "If we go before anyone wakes up, it's just us and the tiles." She made it sound like a date.

"The smell is worse in the morning," I said, mostly to see how it sounded out loud.

Rafa wrinkled her nose. "Yeah, but that's why it looks so moody. Like steam. Like... old building. You know?" She waved a hand. If you want to be an influencer, you have to be able to wave away reality with one wrist flick.

I thought of the older man in the kitchen yesterday, the way he'd rattled the window, the word gas in his mouth like a complaint and a prayer. I thought of Joana's tired eyes. I thought of my bank app, the red numbers, the brand DM asking for another mention. I thought of the comment under my post, *Girl, are you actually smoking inside?*

"We can keep the door cracked," I said, which was a compromise that felt like a lie.

"It ruins the light," Rafa said, and then smiled as if she was joking, as if that wasn't the exact thing that was going to kill me.

A notification popped up on my screen. *@HostelReaper added to their story.* I didn't follow the account, but someone had tagged it under my latest post, some dark-humor thing about hostels and worst-case scenarios. I tapped it before I could tell myself not to. The story was a grainy photo of a lighter in a hand, thumb poised on the wheel, with text scrawled over it: SOME RULES ARE WRITTEN IN SMOKE. The location tag was blank. The caption in tiny font said, *Seen in a kitchen like yours.*

I frowned and closed it. It felt like the universe had started subtweeting me.

Rafa leaned forward. "So? Tomorrow?"

I heard myself say yes. I heard the word leave my mouth like it was on a track, like it had been scheduled and approved. "Tomorrow," I said. "We'll be quick." The lemon tree trembled in a small gust of wind, and a leaf fell into my coffee.

We spent the rest of the morning editing in the common room, laptops open, the soundtrack of the hostel a constant loop of clinking mugs and whispered phone calls. I smoothed the color on my skin until I looked like a porcelain doll. I erased the shadow under my eyes. The screen made me look safe. The air around me did not.

Around noon, Joana appeared at the desk, cheeks flushed, hair pulled back tight. She held a clipboard like it was armor. When she saw me, she hesitated, then walked over, lowering her voice.

"Did you sleep okay?" she asked.

"Mostly," I said.

"If you go in the kitchen, please open the courtyard door. All the way." Her eyes flicked to my phone, then back to me. There was a plea there, the kind that doesn't bother to put on a smile.

"I will," I said, because the word felt easier than the truth. I meant it in that moment. It's amazing how sincere you can be in the moment right before you change your mind.

She nodded and went back to the desk. A man in a linen shirt appeared at her side—Pedro. He had the kind of tan that comes from money and travel, not sun. He smiled at me and asked, "How is the content?" like that was the only thing that mattered.

"It's good," I said. It was true and it wasn't.

"Tag the hostel when you post," he said. "We are almost at twenty thousand locations." He said it like it was a small miracle. He didn't mention the smell. He didn't mention the hissing. He didn't mention the way Joana's jaw clenched every time he walked past the kitchen.

I watched him go and felt something sour rise in my throat, a taste that wasn't quite gas. When I lifted my coffee, it tasted like metal.

In the afternoon, I escaped to the streets because I couldn't breathe inside. The city had a way of rinsing me off. Lisbon smelled like roasted chestnuts and sea salt, like diesel and sun on stone. I walked downhill toward Baixa and tried to pretend I was a normal person on a normal trip, not a girl chasing light and running from her own head.

Felix met me by the fountain with his camera and a paper bag. "Pastel de nata," he said, offering it like a peace treaty. The pastry was warm, the custard sweet, the crust flaking onto my jeans. The sugar stuck to my fingers, honest and simple. I licked it off and felt, for a second, like I belonged in my own life.

"You look like you didn't sleep," he said.

"Content never sleeps," I said, and rolled my eyes to make it a joke.

He snapped a photo of me biting the pastry. I watched him check the screen, then tilt his head. "You're good at the light," he said, as if it was a compliment and not an indictment.

We walked through a small alley where a shop had a display of smoke detectors in the window, neon boxes stacked in a tower. A sign taped to the glass said *PROMOCAO* in bold letters. I paused without meaning to. Felix kept walking. I followed him like I hadn't noticed, like my eyes hadn't caught on the word GAS printed on a package.

"Are you okay?" he asked later, when we were sitting on the steps by the miradouro, the city spread out below us like a postcard.

"I'm fine," I said.

He looked at me the way he sometimes did, like he wanted to photograph the moment behind my words. "You should go to bed earlier," he said. "That kitchen is not worth your health." He said kitchen like a place and not a weapon.

"It's just a smell," I said.

"Some smells are warnings," he said, and ate the last of his pastry. The crust flaked onto his sweater. He brushed it away and the crumbs fell to the stone like tiny bones.

My phone buzzed. Another notification. I looked down, expecting a like or a brand DM. It was my mother. *Did you see that story about the building fire in Porto? I'm worried about you.*

I didn't reply. I put my phone face down and watched the light shift across the rooftops. The city was a collage of terracotta and blue, of narrow streets and iron balconies. It was beautiful. It was old. It had burned before and had the soot to prove it.

Felix asked if I wanted to shoot at golden hour. I said yes because yes is my default. We spent an hour taking photos along the river. The light was soft, the wind sharp. The river smelled like salt and algae. It was real. It was not the light I was obsessed with. I thought about the kitchen while my hair blew in the Tagus wind and felt a small, sick ache in my chest. The light I wanted was a controlled light, an indoor light, a light that came with rules and smells and closed windows. The light I wanted was a trap I kept walking into.

On the walk back, Felix asked if I was still in the dorm with Jessa. I told him she'd left. He nodded and said, "She had good instincts." It sounded like he meant it.

"Do I?" I asked.

He looked at me and smiled in a way that wasn't for the camera. "Sometimes," he said. "When you listen to them." He swung his camera around his shoulder and headed toward the hostel. I followed, carrying my ring light like a bag of groceries.

The kitchen was busy when I got back, the dinner-hour crowd clustering around the stove like it was a campfire. Pots steamed, lids clattered, people moved in the cramped space with the delicate choreography of strangers who didn't want to touch. The smell of garlic and onions fought with the sweet, metallic edge underneath. The food won for a minute, then the air took it back.

Dylan was there, shirtless in the way Australians seem to do as a joke, stirring a pot with one hand and holding his phone in the other. He grinned when he saw me. "Morning, queen," he said, even though it was late afternoon. "You bringing your ring light to dinner too?"

I held it up like a shield. "It needs to eat."

He laughed. "Same." He leaned closer, lowered his voice. "Smell's worse today. I opened the door earlier and Joana gave me the look. You know the look."

"I do," I said.

At the far end of the counter, a small girl in a yellow hoodie was rinsing rice in a bowl, her movements careful, almost delicate. She looked up when I glanced her way and gave a shy smile. "Hi," she said. "I'm Yuki." Her accent was soft, Japanese, the kind that made English sound like a necklace.

"Sienna," I said.

Beside her, a tall guy in a green hoodie was filling a bottle from the tap, letting the water run longer than necessary. He looked tired in the way people look after too many flights. He nodded. "Lucas," he said. Brazilian, if the football crest on his bag hadn't already told me.

The back burner clicked, and Joana appeared in the doorway like a summoned ghost. "No, no," she said quickly, crossing the room and turning the knob. "Only the front. Please." She didn't look at anyone for too long, as if eye contact would make it her fault.

"It's not working?" Lucas asked.

"Old pipes," Joana said, the line polished from overuse. She opened the courtyard door and cold air cut through the room, flattening the light and the smell at the same time. Dylan grimaced like she'd taken his dessert away.

Yuki leaned toward me. "It smells strange," she whispered.

"It's the drains," I said automatically, the lie so easy it might have been true.

She frowned. "In Tokyo, drains don't smell like that."

I laughed because I didn't know what else to do. "Lisbon drains are extra."

Dylan lifted his spoon, sniffed, and grimaced. "It smells like a fart that went to college," he said. "Fancy but still a fart."

Lucas chuckled. "Is it dangerous?"

Joana glanced at him, then away. "Just... open the door," she said, her voice gentle but tired. "Okay?"

We nodded like good guests and kept cooking, because that's what everyone does when they don't want to be the person who ruins the vibe. I set my phone on the counter and took a short video of the steam rising off Dylan's pasta, the tiles blurred behind it. It looked like a cozy kitchen in a travel ad. The smell didn't make it into the clip.

As the room warmed, my head started to throb again, that slow, polite pressure behind my eyes. I took a sip of water and told myself I'd been staring at screens all day. Yuki coughed once and rubbed her temple. Lucas opened the door wider without asking. The air shifted. The light changed. The tiles looked more honest.

"You guys ever get dizzy in here?" Dylan asked, tossing his pasta with one hand. "Like, not drunk dizzy. Just, like, your brain's swimming."

"Too much coffee," Lucas said.

"Not enough food," I said.

Yuki didn't say anything. She just kept rinsing her rice, then looked toward the stove with a small crease between her brows. The pilot light was out again. The hiss behind the stove threaded through the chatter, soft but there. I heard it. I ignored it. That's how you survive hostel kitchens, I guess. You ignore the parts that don't fit the story you're telling.

We ate together at the long table, paper plates and mismatched forks, the kind of communal dinner that would have felt charming if I hadn't been counting calories in my head. Dylan asked where we were all from. Lucas said Belo Horizonte. Yuki said Osaka. I said Essex but added, "near London," because that's the version of me that gets more likes.

Someone made a joke about the NO SMOKING sign, how it was always being replaced, like it was a living thing. Dylan mimed taping up another one. We laughed. The kitchen door swung closed behind Joana, and the smell pooled again at our feet.

By the time we finished eating, my headache was blooming. The room felt too warm. I stood up too fast and the world tilted. I grabbed the edge of the table and smiled like I wasn't seeing stars. Yuki touched my arm. "You okay?" she asked.

"Yeah," I said. "Just haven't eaten all day." It was a partial truth. It felt better than the real one.

When I left the kitchen, the hallway smelled clean by comparison. I told myself I should drink water, should sit in the courtyard, should do anything but go back inside. I went upstairs instead. The light in my room was flat, the kind that doesn't forgive. I opened my camera anyway and searched for an angle that made me look like I wasn't unraveling.

---

The hostel was louder than when I'd left, the usual afternoon churn. The common room had turned into a co-working space, everyone hunched over laptops, the Wi-Fi groaning under the weight. The smell from the kitchen threaded through it all like a reminder. It was easier to ignore with a screen in front of my face. It was harder to ignore when you had to walk past the kitchen door to get to the stairs.

I went into the kitchen because I couldn't help myself. The tiles were lit by the low afternoon sun, a wash of honey that made them glow like an altar. The dead plant in the corner looked even more dead in that light, black leaves crisp, the pot dusted with a fine grey film. A sign on the wall had been replaced again. NO SMOKING. The ink looked fresh. The paper still stiff. Someone was trying, at least, to say the thing out loud.

The kitchen was empty except for Maria. She stood at the counter with her electric kettle, hands moving in the rhythm of someone who had been doing the same routine for decades. She saw me and paused, the cloth in her hand still, and then crossed herself like the room had just told her a secret.

"You go in here again," she said.

"I'm just getting water," I lied, because that was easier than saying I wanted the light.

She shook her head. "Bad air." She nodded toward the stove. The pilot light was out. The knob was turned to off, but the hiss behind the stove was faint and constant, a thin line of sound. I could hear it now even with the fridge humming. It was a sound you could only hear if you stopped pretending you couldn't.

"It's fine," I said. I hated the way the words sounded in my mouth, the way they tasted like a rehearsed line.

Maria stepped closer to the stove, leaned down as if she might smell where the gas was coming from, then stood quickly, making the sign of the cross again. She muttered something in Portuguese, a phrase that sounded like warning and prayer and exasperation rolled into one.

"What did you say?" I asked.

She looked at me, eyes narrowed. "Explosion," she said in English, the word clumsy on her tongue. "It happens." She shrugged, as if that was the point she had reached after years of watching people ignore what was in front of them. "Old buildings." She pointed toward the courtyard door. "Open. Please."

My heart did a small, stupid flutter. I imagined a flash of white in the kitchen, the tiles cracking, the table splintering. I imagined it in the way you imagine a storm when you see a dark cloud: it doesn't feel real until it falls on you. I opened the courtyard door anyway. The cold air rushed in, and the smell thinned. The light flattened. The tiles looked less like a cathedral and more like a kitchen.

"See," Maria said. She went back to her kettle. The red light clicked on, comforting and electric.

I stood in the doorway for a moment, letting the air wash over me. I could have left then. I could have chosen to say no to Rafa, to the cigarette shot, to the light. I could have told myself that my life was worth more than a reel. I could have done a thousand small, sensible things.

Instead, I took a photo of the tiles with the door open, because even muted light is still light, and I went upstairs to edit.

The evening blurred. Dinner was a packet of noodles I didn't finish and a glass of wine I shouldn't have had. The rooftop filled with voices and the thin music from someone's phone. The string lights hummed overhead, casting a warm, flattering glow over everyone. I sat on the edge of a bench, legs swinging, phone in my lap, pretending I was watching the city. I was actually watching my numbers rise, little orange hearts popping up like bubbles.

Rafa found me there, a cigarette tucked behind her ear like a pencil. She looked excited, her eyes bright with the kind of adrenaline you get when a plan might go viral.

"Tomorrow," she said again.

"Tomorrow," I said.

She held out her phone. She'd mocked up a storyboard, little screenshots with arrows and captions: *Light cigarette. Slow inhale. Tilt head toward tiles.* It was organized, professional. It made it feel safe. It made it feel inevitable.

"We can use the ashtray from the courtyard," she said. "We'll be so quick, no one will even smell it." She grinned. "Plus, it looks so Lisbon. It's gonna eat."

"We'll be quick," I repeated, because that was the magic phrase now. Quick, like that had ever saved anyone from anything.

Above us, a seagull cried, harsh and sudden, like it knew something the rest of us didn't. I watched it wheel over the rooftops, then disappear. A gust of wind rattled the string lights. I glanced at them, at the thin wires, at the warm bulbs, at the little warning label attached to the cord. *For outdoor use only.* It was probably fine. Everything was probably fine. Lisbon had a way of making danger feel like charm.

I checked my phone and saw a DM from a brand I'd been desperate to work with. *Loved your Lisbon content. Can you deliver one more morning routine by Friday?* My heart did that stupid flutter again. I typed back *Yes!* without thinking. The deal might not pay much, but it would pay in validation. Validation is the currency I spend the fastest.

By the time the rooftop cleared, the wind had turned cold. I went downstairs, past the kitchen door, and felt the sweet smell hit me even before I opened it. The hallway felt heavier at night, like the building had been exhaling all day and had run out of breath. I hesitated, then pushed the door open.

The kitchen was empty, the tiles dark in the low light, the table a black shape. The courtyard door was closed. The hiss behind the stove was faint but there, a thin thread of sound. I stood there for a moment, letting the smell settle around my ankles. It was stronger than it had been in the afternoon. It felt heavier, like the air was thick with something more than scent.

I pulled out my phone and took a short video of the empty kitchen, the way the light pooled on the tiles, the way the shadows made the corners look deeper. I captioned it *night ritual* and saved it to drafts. It looked beautiful. It looked haunted.

I found myself holding the lighter. I don't remember taking it out. It was in my hand, red and warm, the thumb wheel shining. I flicked it once, just to hear the click. The spark snapped in the dark. The sound was small, but it felt loud in the thick air. The flame caught for a split second and went out. I stared at it, heart thudding, and told myself it was nothing. The smell didn't change. The hiss didn't stop. The tiles didn't care.

I put the lighter back in my pocket and left the kitchen without turning on a light, as if the darkness would forgive me if I didn't look too closely.

---

Upstairs, the dorm was quiet. A new girl had taken Jessa's bed, her stuff sprawled out in a way that said she didn't plan to stay long. She was asleep already, earplugs in, a scarf draped over her eyes. I climbed into my bunk and stared at the ceiling. My phone screen glowed against the dark, a little window that never closed.

I opened the alarm app and set it for 6:40. I set a second alarm for 6:43 because the light app said that was the exact minute the tiles would glow without shadows. I labeled them *shoot* and *backup*. I felt ridiculous and powerful at the same time.

A notification popped up from @HostelReaper again, another story. I hesitated, then tapped it. This time it was a photo of a blue-and-white tile wall, no location tag, a crack running through the pattern like a vein. The text read: LIGHT IS NOT LOVE. The story vanished before I could decide how I felt about it.

I lay back and listened to the building settle. The hiss behind the stove carried through the floorboards, a soft, continuous whisper. It felt like a countdown. I told myself I was being dramatic. I told myself everyone in this building smelled the same thing and no one was exploding. I told myself I'd been in worse situations. I told myself that if something was really wrong, someone would do something about it.

Somewhere below, a door closed. The building shifted. The hiss continued. The phone glowed. The alarm was set.

I closed my eyes and tried to imagine tomorrow's shot, the smoke curling, the tiles glowing, my face turned toward the light like it could save me. The image was so clear, so pretty, that for a second I forgot the smell. For a second I forgot the warning in Maria's eyes, the way Felix had said some smells are warnings, the way Joana had begged me to open the door. For a second, all I wanted was the shot.

That was the last thing I thought about before sleep took me: a perfect light in a room that was quietly filling with something I didn't want to name.
