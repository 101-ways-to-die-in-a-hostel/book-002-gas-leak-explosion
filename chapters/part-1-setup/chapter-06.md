# Chapter 06: The Free Night

I woke with the taste of pennies in my mouth and a headache that felt like a cheap headband, too tight and too synthetic. For a second I thought I had fallen asleep with lipstick on and eaten it. Then the smell curled up from the stairwell and I remembered: the kitchen. The gas. The tiles. The shot.

My alarm said 4:47. The sun wasn't up yet. The room was a soft blue shadow, the laundry outside the window hanging like a row of ghosts. Jessa's breathing was slow and heavy below me. The French girl had her arm flung over her eyes. The air in the dorm was thin but not clean, as if the smell had learned how to climb.

I pulled on a hoodie and climbed down the ladder, careful not to shake the bed. My phone was already in my hand. My thumb hovered over Instagram out of habit, the reflex of a morning prayer. There was a DM from Pedro waiting for me: *Don't forget to tag in the morning. The light is best early. Enjoy the extra nights.* He had added a winking emoji, which made me want to laugh and gag at the same time.

Free nights. The kind of phrase that feels like a rescue rope when you're treading water. The kind of phrase that makes you ignore the smell.

I left the dorm and went down the stairs. The hallway air was warmer, heavier. It pressed on my face like a wet cloth. The closer I got to the kitchen, the thicker it became. By the time I reached the door, my eyes had started to sting. I told myself it was just because I hadn't slept enough. I told myself I was fine. I opened the door and stepped inside.

The kitchen was dark except for the faint blue glow of the stove clock. The tiles were a quiet shadow of themselves. I flicked on my ring light and the room bloomed into blue and white, the azulejos catching the light like a million small mirrors. The houseplant in the corner had finally committed to death. Its leaves were curled into brown fists, brittle enough to snap if you looked at them.

The smell was worse than the night before. It was rotten eggs and metal and something sweet, a sweetness that made the back of my throat go tight. I breathed through my mouth and tasted it anyway. The air felt thick near the floor, like it had settled there and refused to rise. I imagined it pooled under the table, under the stove, under my feet. I told myself I was being dramatic. I told myself that was content too.

I set my phone on the table and hit record. The coffee cup was already where I wanted it. The packet of cigarettes sat just out of frame, the warning label turned away. I reached into my bag for the lighter, the one that had been stubborn yesterday. I rolled it between my fingers like a coin I wasn't sure I wanted to spend.

The NO SMOKING sign glared at me from the wall. It was laminated, the edges peeling, like it had been here longer than the stove. The sign said no. My bank app said yes.

I held the cigarette between my fingers, unlit. I posed, turned my wrist, tilted my chin toward the light. The camera loved me. It always did. It didn't care that my eyes were watering.

I flicked the lighter.

It caught on the first try. A tiny flame bloomed, a blue-yellow tongue that made the tiles flash for a heartbeat. The smell in the air seemed to brighten, as if it was waiting for that spark. My stomach dipped, a tight little roll of instinct. I blew the flame out fast enough that it left a faint ghost of smoke on the wick.

I stood there with the lighter in my hand, the cigarette between my fingers, the flame's ghost in my eyes. For a second I felt the room lean toward me, holding its breath. I told myself it was the early hour. I told myself it was the ring light.

The door creaked behind me.

I snapped the lighter closed and smiled as Joana stepped in. She had her cardigan wrapped around her like armor, hair pulled back in a knot that had loosened overnight. She smelled like lemon cleaner and sleep deprivation.

"You're up," she said. It was not a question.

"Light is best early," I said, and tried to make it sound like a joke.

Her eyes landed on the cigarette, then on the lighter, then on the sign. She didn't need to say anything. I put the cigarette on the saucer like I was done with it.

"It's worse this morning," she said, and nodded toward the stove. Her voice was low, like she didn't want the room to hear her.

"I noticed," I said, because denial would have felt childish.

She opened the courtyard door a crack. Cold air pushed in, sharp and clean, the way a confession feels. The smell thinned immediately. The light flattened. My heart sank with a weird, guilty sting.

"Please," she said. "Just keep it open. Five minutes. Ten. It's not safe in here."

The word safe hung in the air between us, like a balloon neither of us wanted to grab. I nodded and kept smiling. The camera was still recording.

"Pedro says you tagged us," she said, softer, almost apologetic. "He said he will give you two nights."

"He will," I said. "He already did."

She didn't smile. She looked like someone who had watched a small stone roll down a hill and knew it would turn into an avalanche. "You don't have to," she said. "You don't owe him anything."

I laughed, because that's what you do when you feel cornered. "Tell my bank account that," I said.

Joana's mouth did a small twist. "I know," she said. "I just..." She stopped. She looked at the stove, at the painted window, at the floor where the air seemed to settle. "If you feel dizzy, go outside."

"I will," I lied, because it sounded easier than the truth.

She left the door open and disappeared back into the hallway. I stared at the open courtyard, at the lemon tree swaying faintly in the morning breeze. I could hear a bird start its day. I could smell the clean air. I wanted to close the door. I didn't.

I took the shot anyway. The light was flatter, the tiles less divine, but it was still good. I angled the camera to hide the open door, to hide the fact that the kitchen wasn't a still-life but a room with a problem. I posted it with a caption that sounded like a promise: *Slow mornings, fast dreams.* I tagged the hostel and watched the likes begin to roll in.

The free nights felt like a win. The gas smell felt like a warning. I told myself I could hold both things at once.

---

By late morning, the hostel was awake and buzzing. The common room smelled like burnt coffee and sweaty sleep. I sat at the end of the big table, phone in hand, watching my post climb. Pedro reshared it, and the hostel account gained a few followers. My DMs filled with small hearts and questions about where my sweater was from.

A comment popped up: *Is it true the kitchen smells like gas?* It had ten likes already, the kind of curiosity that looks innocent and feels like a needle. I hovered over it and then typed, *Old building, old pipes. It's just Lisbon charm.* I added a laughing emoji to make it light. I hit send and felt something in me shrink.

Jessa dropped into the chair next to me with a bowl of cereal. She looked tired, her eyes rimmed in red. "Headache again," she said, and rubbed her temple with the heel of her hand.

"Drink water," I said, because it was the only advice I had.

"I did." She nodded toward the hallway. "It smells worse today."

"It's probably the drains," I said automatically.

She looked at me like I had just said the wrong line in a play. "Do you hear yourself?"

"That's what everyone says," I said, and tried to smile.

"Everyone says lots of things," she said. "It doesn't make them true."

I didn't answer. I didn't know how to answer. The smell slid under the door to the common room like a guest who refused to leave. The room got quiet for a second as someone opened the kitchen door, and then the noise returned. We were all very good at pretending.

My phone buzzed. A DM from a brand that had ignored me for months: *Love the Lisbon content. Interested in a collab? We can send product.* Product, not money. The word felt like a sugar substitute. I typed back a polite maybe. I couldn't afford to say no.

I went out into the city with Jessa because she said she needed air and I did too, even if I wouldn't admit it. The street outside smelled like coffee and diesel and the sea. It was a clean kind of dirty, a smell that felt alive instead of sick. We walked down toward the river, past a gas truck parked on a narrow street. A worker in a neon vest knelt by a metal cover, his face wrinkled as he leaned into the open hatch.

"Gas company," Jessa said, nodding at the truck. The logo was blue and crisp. The word GAS was printed in friendly letters, like a warning wrapped in a smile.

I watched the worker fit a sensor onto a pipe, a small handheld device with a red light. The red light blinked and he frowned. He looked up and caught my eye. For a second I thought he might say something, but then he looked away and went back to his work.

"Do you ever think," Jessa said, "that the city is just held together by tape and vibes?"

I laughed. "That's my whole brand."

She didn't smile. "I'm thinking about switching hostels," she said. "This place feels wrong."

The word wrong landed in my stomach like a stone. I wanted to say she was overreacting. I wanted to say I'd leave too if I could. Instead I said, "You can't leave. The tiles will miss you."

She shook her head. "You're not listening. I'm serious." She looked out at the river, the Tagus catching the sunlight like a strip of foil. "If I leave, do you stay?"

"I have two free nights," I said. The phrase felt ridiculous on my tongue, like a discount code for a funeral.

"Two nights isn't worth your lungs," she said. "Or your hair." She smiled a little, trying to lighten it. It didn't work.

"My hair is the only thing that's actually insured," I said, and that made her laugh, a small, tired sound.

We walked without speaking for a while. I took a photo of a wall covered in posters for a fado night. I posted it with a caption about nostalgia because that's the kind of word that makes people stop scrolling. In the comments, someone asked if I was staying at Casa dos Azulejos. I didn't answer.

We stopped at a cafe with a row of tiny tables outside. I ordered an espresso I didn't need and a pastel de nata I didn't want but ate anyway. The pastry was warm and sweet and made my headache soften for a second. I watched people pass by, tourists with guidebooks and locals carrying groceries. Life felt normal out here, the way it does when you're far enough away from a problem to pretend it doesn't exist.

My phone buzzed again. Pedro had messaged: *Can you post another kitchen story tonight? The Brazilian group is excited. Tag them too.* It wasn't a request. It was a reminder of the deal. I typed back a thumbs-up emoji and felt the hollowness widen.

Jessa watched me type. "Is that him?" she asked.

"Yeah," I said.

She sighed. "You're trading safety for exposure."

"It's not that dramatic," I said.

"It is," she said, and looked away.

I wanted to be angry at her. I wanted her to stop making me feel like I was doing something wrong just by surviving. But the truth sat there between us, heavy and undeniable. I took a picture of my coffee and posted it with a caption about quiet afternoons because it felt easier than the conversation.

---

We left the cafe and wandered toward the market by the river, the stalls setting up with the slow choreography of people who do this every day. A man arranged postcards of Lisbon sunsets like he was shuffling a deck. A woman hung strings of ceramic sardines that clinked in the breeze. The air was full of fried dough and hot oil and the sharp tang of the river. It felt clean in a way the hostel never did.

Felix found me by the postcard stall, camera already in his hands. He raised it before he said hello, snapped a photo of me in the light, then lowered it with a grin like he'd gotten away with something. "You're everywhere," he said.

"So are you," I said, and smiled for him because reflex is faster than thought.

"I'm doing a tile series," he said. "Not the hostel. The street ones. The old churches. The subway." He held his camera up and framed a wall of azulejos that looked like waves. "This city is obsessed with repeating itself."

"It's a mood board," I said. He laughed.

He walked with me for a while, taking photos, pointing out light, talking about a film camera he wanted to buy. He asked if I was still doing the kitchen shot tomorrow. I told him yes, because the word had already become a promise in my mouth.

"You're going to light it?" he asked.

"I have to," I said. "Otherwise it's not the shot."

He frowned. "That place smells like a gas station with a hangover."

"Everyone says it's the drains."

"Everyone says lots of things," he said, echoing Jessa, and that made me bristle. "Just... be careful."

"Careful doesn't trend," I said, and immediately hated how true it sounded.

We stopped at a tiny tobacco shop wedged between a bakery and a tourist trinket store. The door bell chimed when I went in. The air inside smelled like stale smoke and paper. Behind the counter, an older man with thick glasses watched me like he had seen me a thousand times and none of them mattered.

"Lighter," I said, tapping the counter.

He slid a tray toward me. The lighters were cheap plastic, bright colors, a few with Lisbon trams printed on them. I picked a red one because it would pop on camera. He rang it up and then, as if reading my face, said in English, "No smoke inside, yes?"

I laughed like it was a joke. "Of course."

He didn't laugh. "Old buildings here," he said, and pointed vaguely toward the hills. "Beautiful, but they burn. My cousin had a flat in Bairro Alto. Small leak. He lit a candle." He flicked his fingers as if he could summon the memory into flame. "Boom. No more flat."

"That's horrible," I said, and meant it.

"So don't light candles in old buildings," he said, and pushed the lighter toward me. His eyes were kind in a tired way. The kind of kindness that doesn't expect you to listen.

I tucked the lighter into my bag and left the shop, the bell chiming behind me like a warning bell in a church. Outside, the sun had shifted, the light a little harsher. Felix was waiting, leaning against a wall, his camera strap around his wrist.

"Got your flame?" he asked.

"Yep," I said.

He nodded, then lifted his camera and took another shot of me without asking. The red lighter was visible through my bag's open zipper, a small bright promise. "You look like trouble," he said.

"I look like content," I said.

He smiled, but it didn't reach his eyes. We walked back toward the hostel, and I kept thinking about the old man's story, about the way his fingers had flicked to mimic an explosion. It had been so casual, so practiced, as if disaster was just another thing you could buy with a quick warning label.

By the time we reached the hostel street, Felix had peeled off to meet someone for a sunset shoot. I paused outside Casa dos Azulejos and looked up at the blue tiles, the wrought iron, the romantic facade that had hooked me in the first place. The building looked like a postcard. It smelled like a cautionary tale.

We got back to the hostel in the late afternoon, the light already turning honey. The hallway smelled like lemon cleaner and that underlying rot. Joana stood at the desk, talking to a man with a clipboard and a small toolbox. He had the look of a contractor who had been called too many times for too little money.

"We don't need a full inspection," Pedro was saying, his voice sharp but smooth. "Just check the burner. It goes out sometimes."

The man glanced down the hall toward the kitchen, his eyes narrowing slightly. "I can look," he said, sounding noncommittal.

"It's fine," Pedro said. He smiled at me as I passed, the kind of smile that sells you on a view. "Sienna. The post did well. Thank you." He made a small gesture like tipping a hat. I nodded and kept walking.

Joana's eyes followed me for a second. There was a question in them that she didn't ask. I didn't answer anyway.

I dropped my bag on my bed and went down to the kitchen because the light was good and Pedro had asked and the Brazilian group had filled the room with laughter and a constant stream of photos. The tiles were beautiful in the late light, the blue deep and rich. The smell was worse again, hot and sweet beneath the garlic and cheap wine.

A girl with dark curls was taking a selfie with the stove behind her. A guy with a cap was stirring a pot, his hand shaking slightly as the flame sputtered. The pilot light went out, caught again, went out again. The pot bubbled. The smell thickened.

"It keeps dying," he said, and laughed like it was a joke.

"Use the front," Joana said from the doorway. She pushed through the crowd, her expression tight. "Please. Only the front."

"Why?" the girl with the curls asked, still smiling at her phone.

"Old pipes," Joana said. "Bad air."

"It's giving me a headache," someone else said, and a few people nodded.

"It's the drains," a British guy said, and the line was passed around the room like a cigarette. Laughter broke, a little too loud, a little too forced. I laughed too.

I set my phone on the table and hit record. Wine glasses, hands, laughter, tiles. The smell was not in the frame. I moved the cigarette pack to the edge of the shot, the warning label hidden. I didn't take one out. Not with this many people in the room. Rules are for guests, not creators, but even I had limits when there were witnesses.

The contractor stepped into the kitchen, pushing past the group. He looked around, nose twitching. He crouched by the stove and put his hand near the back, where the pipe ran. He frowned. He said something to Pedro in Portuguese I didn't understand. Pedro shook his head. The man stood, wiped his hands on his jeans, and left the room without touching the stove. He didn't look at me. He didn't look at Joana. He looked like someone who had made a decision he didn't want to admit.

The gas smell seemed to swell after he left, as if the room had noticed it had been observed. I swallowed and told myself it was my imagination. I focused on the light, on the laugh lines at the edges of people's mouths, on the way the tiles caught the orange glow of sunset. I posted the story with the tags Pedro wanted, and watched the view count tick up in real time.

Later, when the crowd thinned, I stood alone by the sink and washed a coffee cup I hadn't used, just to have something to do. The water ran cold and slow. The smell was still there, sitting in the back of my throat. My head throbbed again, a dull drumbeat behind my eyes.

"You good?" Dylan asked from the doorway. He had a beer in one hand and a towel over his shoulder.

"Just tired," I said.

"You should sleep," he said, as if it were a new idea. He smiled, then lowered his voice. "It really does smell like gas, though. I had that in a surf hostel in Bali once. They shut the whole place down for a day."

"This place won't shut down," I said, and it sounded like a compliment and a curse at the same time.

"Everything shuts down eventually," he said, and wandered off.

I put the cup back on the shelf and looked at the NO SMOKING sign. The letters were bold, the laminate peeling. I imagined what the smoke would look like in this light, curling up the wall like an apology. The image made my fingers itch.

---

At night, the hostel breathed louder. Doors slammed, laughter bounced up the stairwell, a guitar tried to find the right chord and gave up. I went up to the rooftop for air. The city lights stretched below like a net. The wind was cold and clean. I took a photo of the skyline and posted it because it was easier than thinking.

Jessa joined me, wrapped in a hoodie. She leaned on the railing and watched the lights.

"I found a new place," she said.

"Already?" I tried to sound surprised. I wasn't.

"Tomorrow," she said. "I leave tomorrow." She glanced at me. "You should come."

"I have to get the shot," I said, because that was the truth that had become a religion. "It's my last chance before the light changes."

She shook her head. "The light is not worth this."

"You don't understand," I said, and regretted it immediately.

"I do understand," she said. "That's why I'm leaving." She touched my arm, a quick, gentle gesture. "Just be careful."

I wanted to say I was careful. I wanted to say I was in control. I wanted to say anything that would make her stay. I said, "I will."

She smiled, sad and tired. "Okay." She looked back at the city and let the conversation die.

Back in the dorm, I set my alarm for 4:47. I laid out my clothes, my ring light, the fresh pack of cigarettes. I took the lighter from my bag and tested it once, outside the open window, just to be sure. The flame sprang up easily in the night air, bright and obedient. I snapped it shut and felt a small relief that made my stomach turn.

I opened my notes app and typed a caption: *The light will ruin you if you let it.* I deleted it. I typed: *Some mornings are worth the risk.* I kept that one.

The smell from downstairs was stronger than it had ever been, even on the fourth floor. It slipped under the door, faint and persistent. I spritzed perfume and made a story about "nighttime reset," because sometimes the lie needs a little fragrance. The likes came in and my chest eased for a second.

I lay in bed with the lighter on the pillow next to me like a charm. I thought about Jessa leaving, about Joana's tired eyes, about the contractor's silence. I thought about my mother, about the bank app, about the comments asking if it was safe. I thought about the shot, the way the smoke would curl, the way the tiles would glow, the way the light would make me look like someone who had everything figured out.

Downstairs, the kitchen was a dark mouth, breathing. The hiss behind the stove threaded through the night like a quiet warning. I told myself I would be quick. I told myself the flame would be small. I told myself a lot.

When I finally fell asleep, I dreamed of a white light that was brighter than any ring light, and I woke with the taste of pennies still in my mouth.
