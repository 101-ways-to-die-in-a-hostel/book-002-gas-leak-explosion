# Chapter 04: The Window Won't Open

The wheel clicked under my thumb, and for a blink there was a spark and the air seemed to hold its breath. The flame didn't catch. The lighter gave me a blue stutter and then nothing, as if it were too polite to do what I was asking in this room.

I flicked it again. The spark jumped, tiny and sharp, and died. The cigarette sat between my lips like a promise I couldn't keep. The smell in the kitchen was so thick it tasted like a dare. I held my breath without meaning to and smiled at my phone anyway, because the camera doesn't care if you're scared.

---

A footstep in the hall. The door creaked. The lighter went back into my palm and my face went into neutral, that influencer blankness that says I'm not doing anything wrong because I'm not doing anything real. Joana slipped inside, her braid loose this morning, and behind her was a man I hadn't seen before.

He was in his fifties, tan in a way that said expensive vacations, linen shirt open at the neck, a small gold chain catching the ring light. He walked like he owned the floor and the floor agreed. He looked past me at the tiles, eyes moving with the satisfaction of someone admiring a product he can sell. This had to be Pedro, the owner. The name sat in the air without being spoken. It smelled like money and stubbornness.

"You're up early," he said in English that was fluent but impatient. He didn't wait for my answer. "It is good. The light. You will tag us, yes?"

"I can," I said, because that's the kind of transaction I understand. Exposure for exposure. In his eyes, I was as much a feature of the hostel as the blue tiles.

Joana glanced at the cigarette in my hand. Her mouth twitched, a tiny warning. I slid it behind the cup. The sign on the wall blared NO SMOKING IN KITCHEN like it was a joke I hadn't gotten yet.

Pedro stepped closer to the stove and frowned at the painted window. "People keep asking to open it," he said, touching the frame like he was petting a dog. "But then the light is ruined. The photos look wrong. The reviews say the kitchen is beautiful." He looked at me. "You can see the problem."

I could. The problem was that air didn't photograph. I nodded anyway. "The light is perfect," I said, because that's what he wanted. It was also what I believed in that moment, the way you believe in a filter when it's doing your work for you.

Joana shifted her weight. "The smell is stronger in the mornings," she said, careful, her voice a thread. "People are complaining."

Pedro waved a hand. "The drains. It's always the drains. Old building. We tell them." He glanced at me again, as if my face could be a review. "You haven't complained."

I wanted to say something smart, something that made me sound like I cared about more than my feed. I didn't. I said, "It's fine," because my stomach wanted the shot more than my mouth wanted the truth.

"Good," he said, satisfied, and then, almost kindly, "If you post us, I can give you a free night. Maybe two. You have many followers." He said followers like it meant people had followed me to Lisbon, like I had a caravan behind me.

My chest did a small lift. A free night meant one less charge on my card. It meant I could stretch the trip. It meant I could keep pretending this was a career instead of a slow leak. "That would be amazing," I said, and it was.

Pedro smiled and clapped Joana on the shoulder as if to remind her who paid for the shampoo. He left without opening the window. The air didn't move. The smell didn't go away. Joana watched him go with an expression that wasn't quite anger or resignation, something more complicated and tired.

"I'm sorry," she said quietly, as if she was apologizing for the building itself.

"It's okay," I said. I meant it, and I didn't.

She looked at the lighter in my hand and then at me. "Please don't," she said, and there was something like fear in her voice. She didn't say the word gas. She didn't have to.

"I won't," I said. I put the cigarette down. I took the shot without lighting it, the way you take a photo of a cake you don't eat.

Joana nodded, then crossed to the counter. She grabbed the lemon cleaner and misted the air, the scent bright and useless. "If you feel dizzy," she said, as if reciting a note she'd been forced to memorize, "go outside."

"I will." I kept my smile on. It was the only thing that felt steady.

She left. The kitchen was mine again. I stared at the tiles, at the stove, at the black line of pipe behind it, painted white like an apology. A faint hiss from that direction made me pause. The sound was soft, like a whisper you couldn't quite make out. I told myself it was the fridge. I told myself the fridge always hummed.

I posted the shot anyway. The caption came easy: *Some mornings are too pretty to be safe.* I added a skull emoji because it felt funny and honest at the same time. The likes started trickling in. A tiny relief flooded my chest. I didn't know I was holding my breath until I could exhale.

---

By nine, the hostel was fully awake. The common room smelled like burnt coffee and deodorant and that underlying rotten sweetness that no one named. I sat on the edge of a couch, phone in hand, and watched my post crawl across my feed. It wasn't going viral. Nothing ever did. But Pedro's offer was in my head like a coin I'd found on the street. I could stretch this trip. I could keep moving. I could keep being the version of myself that didn't need a plan B.

Jessa dropped beside me, hair still damp from a shower. She sipped her coffee and made a face. "It tastes like someone boiled a shoe," she said.

"It's the free part," I said. We both laughed, and then we both coughed a little as the kitchen door opened and the smell rolled in. A few heads turned. A few eyes rolled. The routine of pretending settled over us like a blanket.

"You're up early again," she said.

"I always am," I said. "You should come with me today. I'm doing a tram shot."

"Tram 28?"

"Obviously." I lifted my phone and showed her my notes. "I want a shot in the doorway, hair in the wind, sunlight. It's going to be so good."

"It sounds like a good way to fall out of a moving vehicle," she said.

"That's why it will do numbers," I said.

She laughed. "You're ridiculous," she said, and that was the closest to a compliment I knew how to take.

We went out together. The morning was crisp, the kind that makes your skin feel awake. The city smelled like coffee and sea salt and fried sardines from a grill that was already smoking. We climbed a hill and squeezed into the yellow tram with a dozen other tourists and three locals who looked like they'd been doing this their whole lives.

Inside, the tram was a rattle of metal and old wood, the windows smeared with fingerprints. I pressed myself into a corner, phone up, and filmed the way the sunlight sliced through the windows in golden bands. My hair went wild in the wind that blew through the open door. I thought about falling and felt a thrill that wasn't fear but something close.

"Hold the bar," Jessa said, hand on my elbow.

"I am," I lied.

The tram lurched around a bend and my shoulder hit a brass pole. A woman in front of me smiled like she didn't mind. I took a quick photo of her profile, the way her earrings caught the light, and then didn't post it because strangers are better as silhouettes.

At the top of the hill we got out and walked down through Alfama, the streets narrow and steep, the tiles on the walls cool under my fingertips. Every door was a story. Every doorway was a backdrop. I shot a story of a cat asleep on a stair, and another of Jessa's boots on cobblestones. She rolled her eyes but let me.

"Do you ever just look at things without filming them?" she asked, not unkindly.

"Sometimes," I said, and knew it was a lie. The phone was a lens and a shield. Without it, I didn't know what to do with my hands.

We stopped at a small cafe where the espresso smelled real and the cups weren't chipped. I took photos anyway. The barista slid two pastries across the counter and said something in Portuguese that I didn't catch. Jessa smiled and said obrigada, her accent messy but brave. I smiled too, and wished my own words came as easily as my captions.

We sat outside. The table was small, the sun warm on my wrists. I took a bite of the pastry and felt the sugar hit my tongue like a tiny joy I hadn't earned. It was almost enough to make me forget the smell waiting back at the hostel. Almost.

My phone buzzed. A DM from a brand called The Bare Room, offering me a free candle if I posted three stories and a feed post. Free. Always free. I stared at the message, then at my bank app, then back at the message. The number in my account made my throat tight. I hit "reply" and typed, *Thanks! My rate for a feed post is...* I left the message unfinished and put the phone down. I didn't know what my rate was because I didn't know what I was worth.

"Everything okay?" Jessa asked.

"Yeah," I said. "Just work." I tried to smile. It felt brittle.

She didn't push. She just sipped her coffee and watched the tourists file past like a procession of mirrors.

We wandered through a market by the river. Stalls of old postcards, tarnished jewelry, faded maps of Lisbon. I held a map from the 1930s, the paper crackling, and imagined a version of myself living in that time, before the internet, before you could monetize a sunrise. I pictured her sitting in a kitchen, smelling gas, not posting it. The thought was ridiculous and a little sad.

A man at a stall asked if I wanted to buy a lighter shaped like a fish. I almost said yes, because the lighter was kitsch and the lighter was my prop and the lighter was my doom. I didn't. I walked away with a postcard of the city in black and white, because it felt like something you should have if you're pretending to know a place.

We cut inland toward the cathedral because Jessa wanted to sit in the cool and \"feel guilty,\" her phrase, and because the light around the stone steps was soft and forgiving. Inside, the air smelled like wax and old stone. It was the opposite of the hostel kitchen. It was clean in a way that made my chest feel weirdly tight, like my body didn't know what to do with it.

People were scattered in the pews, heads bowed, a few tourists wandering with cameras on silent. I slid into a back row and let my eyes adjust to the dim. The stained glass threw patches of red and blue on the floor, the colors like bruises. Jessa closed her eyes and let her shoulders drop. She looked peaceful in a way I wasn't sure I could do.

I took my phone out on instinct, then put it back. The light was beautiful, but it felt wrong to steal it. I rested my hands on my knees and listened to the quiet. The quiet was loud. It made my own thoughts sound like a voice I couldn't mute.

I thought about my parents in their kitchen in Essex, the one with the avocado-green tiles my mum refuses to replace because they're \"vintage.\" I thought about my father's eyes when he asked about rent, the way they slid away when I said \"content creator\" like it was a punchline. I thought about how I had come to Lisbon to find myself and found mostly my reflection in my own phone.

My phone buzzed in my pocket. I didn't check it. I told myself I didn't care. The silence didn't let me believe it.

When we left, the sun hit my face so hard it made me blink. A man at the cathedral steps was selling candles. I bought one without knowing why. It was cheap, plain, a stubby cylinder wrapped in plastic. It felt like a talisman in my hand, something to light in a room that wouldn't let you open a window.

Outside, a street performer played a mournful tune on a guitar. A small crowd had gathered, coins clinking in a hat. I filmed five seconds and stopped. I liked the sound more than the shot. The music followed us down the steps and into the street, then dissolved into the city noise.

By afternoon, my head had that familiar tight band again. The kind of headache that sits behind your eyes and makes the world feel a little far away. I bought a bottle of water and two ibuprofen at a farmacia and told myself it was the cobblestones, the sun, the fact that I hadn't slept enough. It couldn't be the air. The air wasn't a thing you could carry with you.

We stopped at a miradouro overlooking the river. The view was a painting. I framed myself against it and asked Jessa to take a photo. She did, and I could tell by the way she held the phone that she wasn't trying to make me look better. She was trying to make me look real. It scared me.

"You look tired," she said, handing the phone back.

"That's my face," I said, and laughed, but it didn't land.

I opened the photo. It was good. It was honest in a way I usually avoid. You could see the line between my brows, the slight darkness under my eyes. I posted it anyway, because honesty is trending, and because I was too tired to filter myself.

The likes came slower than I wanted. I pretended not to care. I cared.

---

When we got back to the hostel, the air in the hallway felt thick again, as if the building had exhaled while I was gone. I dropped my bag on my bunk and pulled my sweater off. The smell had woven itself into the fabric. I sprayed perfume and filmed a quick story about "resetting after a long day" because suffering does well if you dress it up.

In the common room, Dylan was lounging on a couch, a towel around his neck, hair still damp from a shower. He nodded at me. "You alive?"

"Barely," I said.

"Kitchen smells like a science experiment," he said. "I opened the door. Joana glared at me like I set fire to her laptop." He grinned. He liked being lightly rebellious. It looked good on him.

Joana was at the reception desk, tapping her pen against the counter. She looked up when she heard her name and shook her head. She didn't smile. She didn't stop tapping.

"Pedro was here this morning," I said to Jessa as we put our bags away.

"The owner?"

"Yeah. He offered me a free night if I tagged the hostel." I tried to sound casual. It came out excited.

"Did you take it?"

"Of course."

Jessa's mouth did a small twist. "Do you feel weird about it?"

"It's a business," I said, and then, because it sounded cold even to me, "Everyone uses everyone. It's the system."

"Maybe," she said. "But maybe the system is..." She trailed off and shrugged. She had a way of not finishing sentences that made me want to finish them for her and never be wrong.

I went down to the kitchen around six because the light was changing and I wanted a shot of the tiles in the evening glow. The room was empty, quiet except for the hum of the fridge. I set my phone on the table and began to frame. The smell was worse than in the morning, a sweet rot that felt like it was clinging to the back of my throat.

The NO SMOKING sign glared at me. I thought about Pedro's offer, about the free night, about my cards. I thought about the way smoke would curl in the light and make the shot look like a scene from a film. I pulled the cigarette pack from my bag and set it near the cup. I didn't take a cigarette out. Not yet. I told myself this was just a still.

The door opened behind me. A group of guests piled in with groceries, laughing in a mix of English and Spanish. The room filled with bodies and the smell lifted a little, diluted by perfume and sweat. A woman turned the stove knob and the flame popped on. She yelped and laughed. The fire was blue and small, then it sputtered and dipped.

"It keeps going out," she said.

"Use the front only!" Joana's voice cut in from the hallway. She appeared, breathless, like she'd been called. "Not the back. The back is not good."

"Why?" someone asked. A German guy with a man bun looked genuinely curious.

Joana opened her mouth, closed it, opened it again. "It is old," she said. "Please."

The man bun shrugged and slid the pot forward. The flame flickered, steadied. A faint hiss rose from behind the stove, quieter than the music playing on someone's phone. I heard it anyway. It threaded through the chatter like a note only I could hear.

A girl at the table rubbed her temples. "Does anyone else have a headache?" she asked.

"The drains," Dylan called from the doorway. "It's always the drains." People laughed. I did too, because it was the line we all shared, the joke we all needed.

I took my shot and got out of the way. The kitchen felt crowded and hot. The smell felt heavier when there were more people, as if the gas got jealous and pushed harder. I stepped into the courtyard and breathed. The lemon tree smelled sharp and clean. I leaned against the wall and let my head rest against the cool tile.

Felix found me there, camera around his neck, a cigarette behind his ear like a pencil. He nodded. "You getting the morning shot tomorrow?"

"That's the plan," I said.

"I can come if you want," he said. "Help with the framing."

I imagined him in the kitchen, the two of us in that blue light, the cigarette smoke curling into the frame. It felt like a collaboration, like the kind of content that could do well. It also felt like a bad idea. I didn't want to say no. I didn't want to say yes.

"Maybe," I said. "If I'm awake."

He smiled. "You're always awake." He took the cigarette from behind his ear and twirled it between his fingers. "You smoke?"

"Only for photos," I said.

"That's the saddest thing I've heard today," he said, and then laughed so I knew he was joking. It still landed.

We sat under the lemon tree for a few minutes, watching the light fade. The hostel grew louder behind us. A guitar started in the common room, someone singing off-key. The smell from the kitchen spilled into the courtyard every time the door swung open, mixing with lemon and smoke and the damp earth of the planters.

Felix showed me a shot he'd taken of the tiles earlier. It was perfect, the light clean, the lines sharp. It made me feel small. "You should post it," I said, because it was true. He shrugged. "Maybe later."

"You don't care about numbers?" I asked.

He smiled, almost embarrassed. "I care about photos. The numbers are just noise." He said it like it was easy. It wasn't. Nothing is.

I nodded like I understood. I didn't. The numbers are the proof. The numbers are the only thing that makes my parents stop asking when I'll get a real job. The numbers are the only thing that keeps me in Lisbon instead of back in Essex. I didn't say any of that. I just said, "Must be nice."

He flicked his cigarette between his fingers and put it back behind his ear. The movement was lazy, practiced. The image of smoke against the tiles settled into my brain like a craving.

---

By night, the hostel was in full noise. People drank on the rooftop, laughter spilling down the stairwell. Someone played a guitar badly in the common room. The smell was everywhere now, a quiet undercurrent that no amount of candles could drown. I put on a playlist and answered a few DMs, the ones that sounded like actual opportunities, the rest I left unopened because maybe if I ignored them they would go away.

I went up to the terrace to film the string lights as they flickered on. The river below was a black ribbon. The air was cold, clean compared to the kitchen. I breathed it like it was medicine.

Dylan leaned on the railing, a beer in hand. He offered it to me. I took a sip and winced. "Warm," I said.

"Everything is warm in Portugal," he said. "Even the problems." He grinned like he was the first person to make the joke.

We watched a group of girls take turns posing on a bench, their phones held at the exact same angle. One of them tried to light a cigarette and the wind blew it out. She laughed and gave up. The wind is a rules enforcer no one argues with.

I told Dylan about Pedro's offer. He whistled. "Free nights for tags? That's a steal." He paused. "Or a bribe."

"It's not a bribe if I'm going to tag them anyway," I said.

"That's what a bribe is," he said, and smiled.

I didn't answer. The conversation drifted to other things: surf spots, travel plans, the best place for cheap ginjinha. The night moved on. I posted the string lights with a caption about Lisbon being magic. It felt true enough.

When the rooftop emptied, I went downstairs. The kitchen door was closed, but the smell pushed through the cracks. I stood in the hallway for a moment, nose wrinkled, and imagined opening the door, walking in, lighting the cigarette, capturing the shot. The image was so clear in my mind I could taste it.

I went in anyway. The room was dark except for the soft glow of the stove clock. The tiles were ghosts. The air was thick. My footsteps sounded too loud on the old floorboards. I didn't turn on the light. I didn't want to see the sign.

I opened the courtyard door and let cold air rush in. It felt like a confession. The smell thinned. The tiles stayed dark. I stood there for a minute, letting the air wash over me. I thought about Joana's face, about her quiet warning. I thought about Pedro's offer. I thought about my bank balance. I thought about the shot.

I closed the door.

The air settled again. The smell came back. It slid around my ankles, soft and insistent. I told myself I would be quick tomorrow. I told myself I'd open the door right after. I told myself the rules were for guests, not creators. I told myself the sign was a suggestion, not a command.

Back in the dorm, I set my alarm for 4:47. I placed the cigarette pack on my pillow like a talisman. I opened my notes and typed a caption: *No filters. Just Lisbon.* I deleted it. I typed: *When the light is this good, rules blur.* I kept that one.

The room was quiet. Jessa shifted in her sleep, mumbling something I couldn't catch. The French girl snored softly. My phone buzzed once with a like, then went still. I stared at the ceiling and listened to the building breathe. The faint hiss from below was steady, a quiet, patient sound.

I closed my eyes and pictured the morning: tiles glowing, coffee steaming, cigarette lit, smoke curling like a ribbon. I could already feel the flame in my hand, the heat on my fingers, the way it would look on camera. I fell asleep with my thumb pressed against the imaginary wheel.
