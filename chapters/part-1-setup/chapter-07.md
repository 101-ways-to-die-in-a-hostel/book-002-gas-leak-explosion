# Chapter 07: The Light Owes Me

At 4:47 the smell woke me before the alarm did. It slid under the dorm door and into my nose, a rotten sweetness that made my mouth water and my stomach tighten. I lay there for a second with my eyes open, listening to the room breathe, and tried to pretend I was still asleep. The smell didn't care. It was like the building was exhaling through the floorboards.

I rolled out of bed and checked my phone. Four new followers overnight. Two comments asking about Lisbon. One DM from a girl in Ohio asking if it was safe there. I didn't answer. I put on the matching set I had laid out the night before, hair still curled from yesterday, and padded down the ladder as quietly as I could. I told myself I was doing this for work. I told myself this was temporary. I told myself the light owed me.

The hallway was darker than the dorm, the air heavier. The gas smell was stronger down here, like it had been building all night and was proud of it. My head throbbed in a slow, polite way, the kind of ache that asks if you want to make a mistake.

The kitchen door was already cracked open. Light leaked through the gap, a thin strip of gold that didn't belong in a building this old. I pushed the door wider and stepped into the room.

Maria was there, the cleaner, her back to me. She wore her blue apron and rubber gloves, her hair tucked under a scarf that looked like it belonged to another century. An electric kettle sat on the table, its cord stretched to the wall like a lifeline. She was wiping the counters with a cloth that smelled like lemons and bleach. The stove was dark, the pilot light off. A small plastic crucifix hung from the corner of a shelf, and as I walked in, Maria touched it with her wet glove and crossed herself.

She turned and saw me. Her face softened into a quick smile that didn't quite make it to her eyes.

"Early," she said in Portuguese, then switched to the English she saved for guests. "Too early for you. You never sleep. Always light, light, light."

"The best light is early," I said, and held up my phone like proof.

She sniffed. "Light is good. Air is bad." She nodded toward the stove, then toward the window that didn't open. "No gas. No fire. Use the kettle, sim?" She said it like a command wrapped in a suggestion.

"I'm just filming," I said.

Maria pursed her lips, a gesture that meant she had seen too many people say the same thing. She set the cloth down and picked up the kettle, shaking it for emphasis. "Only this. Old pipes." She tapped the counter, then pointed at the floor. "Smell. Too much smell."

I nodded, a good guest, a polite influencer. The ring light in my bag felt like a lie. "I won't use the stove," I said.

She made a soft sound in her throat that could have been relief or doubt. "You are beautiful," she said, then added like an afterthought, "Do not burn." She went back to wiping, the cloth squeaking on the tiles.

The room was colder than the hallway, the tiles cool under my bare feet. The azulejos were a mosaic of blue and white flowers, each one a little different, each one waiting for the morning light to turn them into a backdrop. The houseplant in the corner had finally given up completely. Its stems were brittle and gray, a sculpture of thirst. I made a mental note to move it out of frame.

I set up my ring light on the table, angled just so. I propped my phone against a coffee cup, the cheap ceramic chipped along the rim. The shot in my head was a simple one: a soft morning, a cigarette unlit, a cup of coffee steaming, my hand hovering like a promise. European slow living, the kind of thing that makes people buy plane tickets with their lunch break.

Maria clicked the kettle on. It rattled and hummed. The sound was gentle, almost apologetic.

"You want coffee?" she asked.

"Maybe," I said. The truth was I didn't want coffee, I wanted the cup. I wanted the steam. I wanted the look of someone who drinks coffee in the morning in a tiled kitchen that smells like old money and history.

She poured water into a stained mug and handed it to me. Instant coffee, the cheapest kind, a brown slick of hope. I set it in front of my phone and adjusted the angle until the steam caught the light. It was beautiful. It was also completely fake.

The smell thickened as the kettle boiled. It wrapped around the room like a scarf, warm and unpleasant. I breathed through my mouth and tasted it anyway, a chemical sweetness that made my tongue feel numb. I told myself it was just the drains. I told myself Maria was dramatic. I told myself to stop being weird.

"You smell?" Maria asked, like she could read my mind.

"It's fine," I said.

She shook her head. "No. Not fine. But you are young. You will be fine." She smiled, this time a little more, and then the kettle clicked off. She took her mug and left the room, gliding like a ghost between the tables, the crucifix swinging on its hook.

I had the kitchen to myself. The silence was a kind of pressure. I moved the cup, adjusted the ring light, smoothed the tablecloth. I held my hand above the mug and thought about whether to include the cigarette in the shot. The cigarette was an aesthetic. It was also, according to every sign in the hostel, a rule I was not supposed to break. The rule glared at me from the wall, laminated and peeling. NO SMOKING IN THE KITCHEN. A sentence that sounded like a dare.

I took the cigarette out anyway. I didn't light it. I just let it sit between my fingers for the shot, pale and thin, a fake rebellion. I framed the photo with the tiles in the background, the cup in the foreground, my wrist at the perfect angle. I hit record and held my breath.

The camera captured everything except the smell.

When I watched the clip back, I looked calm. I looked like someone who belonged in a magazine. I didn't look like someone with a headache and a knot in her stomach. I didn't look like someone who was holding a cigarette in a room that smelled like a gas leak. The shot was good. I posted it with a caption that sounded like a lifestyle: *Slow mornings, fast minds.* I tagged the hostel, because that was the deal, and added a little sun emoji like a talisman.

The likes trickled in. The smell stayed.

---

By ten, the hostel was awake, the common room full of half-zipped backpacks and yawns. Jessa was at the table folding her clothes into her pack with the efficiency of someone who has already decided to leave. She looked up when I came in, her eyes a little brighter than yesterday, as if the decision had given her energy.

"Morning," she said. She said it like it was a goodbye.

"You're really going," I said, even though she had told me twice.

"Yes," she said. "I found a place in Alfama. It has plants that are alive." She tilted her head toward me. "You can come if you want."

I sat across from her and wrapped my hands around a mug of hostel coffee. It was bitter and thin. I sipped it anyway. "I have to stay," I said, and tried to make it sound like a choice.

"Because of the free nights?"

"Because of the content," I said.

She smiled sadly. "Same thing to you, isn't it?"

I didn't answer. We both knew it was.

Jessa zipped her bag and stood. "I left a review," she said. "I mentioned the smell."

My stomach dropped. "Why?"

"Because someone should," she said. "Because I don't want to watch you die for a photo." She said it like a joke, but her eyes weren't joking.

"That's dramatic," I said. It was the only line I had.

"So is buying followers," she said, and gave me a look that was half apology, half accusation.

I smiled because I didn't want to fight. "Have a safe hostel," I said.

She laughed, a little too loud. "You too. That's kind of the point." She slung her backpack over one shoulder and then hesitated. "Listen," she said. "Pedro offered me a free night too, last week. I said no. He didn't like it." She chewed her lip, thinking. "He's not a villain. He's just..." She searched for the word.

"Cheap," I said.

"Desperate," she said. "Same as us." She touched my hand for a second, a small, grounding gesture. "Promise me you'll air the kitchen."

"I will," I said, and watched her leave with a promise that felt as thin as the coffee.

The common room felt emptier without her, even as more people filled it. The Brazilian group from last night had taken over the couch, laughing too loudly, already halfway through a bottle of something clear. A German couple sat by the window, laptops open, the glow reflecting in their glasses. The air smelled of toast and hair product and that underlying gas sweetness that had settled into the building like a stain.

I pulled up the hostel's Instagram to see if Pedro had reshared my post. He had, with a caption about golden mornings in Lisbon. The likes on my own post were climbing slower than I wanted. I refreshed and watched the number tick up by one. It was like feeding a pet that never got full.

A new comment popped up: *Does it really smell like gas?* It already had three likes. Jessa's review was live, a small thorn on the hostel's page, and strangers were sniffing around it.

I hovered over the comment. I could delete it. I could answer. I could ignore it. Ignoring felt like admission. Deleting felt like guilt. I typed, *Old buildings have quirks. It's just the drains.* I added a laughing emoji, then a coffee cup, then hit send. The lie slid out of me like it belonged there.

My phone buzzed. A DM from a skincare brand with twelve thousand followers and a logo that looked like a moon: *Obsessed with your Lisbon vibe. Interested in a gifted collab?* Gifted meant free product, not money. It meant work. It meant content. It meant being indebted to a company for a bottle of serum I couldn't resell.

I typed back, *Love this! Send details.*

The smell in the room made my eyes water. I told myself it was from the instant coffee.

Joana walked through the common room with a stack of clean sheets, her jaw tight. When she passed me, she slowed. "Did you open the window this morning?" she asked quietly.

"Maria was in there," I said. "She opened the courtyard door." I didn't tell her I had closed it after I left because the light was better with it shut. That felt like my secret and my crime.

Joana pressed her lips together. "Pedro says he will call someone this week." Her tone said she didn't believe him.

"He had a contractor yesterday," I said.

"He had a friend with a toolbox," she said. "Not the same." She glanced toward the kitchen door, like it might hear her. "Just..." She stopped and then smiled a little, a tight smile. "Enjoy Lisbon. Don't let the building enjoy you." She walked away before I could answer.

I stared at the kitchen door. It was closed. The smell still found a way out.

---

Around noon, I went into the kitchen to rinse my mug and found it already occupied. A Japanese guy I hadn't seen before stood at the stove in flip-flops, a pot of rice on the front burner. He was slim and quiet, moving with the careful precision of someone who has read the instructions. A Brazilian girl filled a water bottle at the sink, her eyes half closed, as if the light was too bright or the air too thick.

The room felt different in daylight. The tiles were almost too bright, the blue so vivid it made everything else look dull. The smell was less obvious when the sun was up, as if it was trying to behave. It was still there, though, a metallic sweetness that sat at the back of my tongue.

The Japanese guy looked up and smiled. "Hi," he said in careful English.

"Hi," I said back, and rinsed my mug under the cold tap. The water ran slow, the pipes wheezing.

He tapped the stove with the back of his spoon. "This one," he said, pointing to the back burner. "No. It dies." He mimed a flame going out with a little hand gesture.

"Joana said only the front," I said.

"Yeah." He shrugged. "Old building. Old everything." He said it with a lightness that felt practiced, the way travelers learn to accept small inconveniences with a smile.

The Brazilian girl squeezed past me to reach the cupboard. "Does it always smell like this?" she asked, wrinkling her nose.

"It's the drains," I said automatically.

She raised her eyebrows, unconvinced. "Drains don't smell sweet," she said.

I laughed. "Maybe Portuguese drains are fancy."

She didn't laugh. "I grew up in Sao Paulo. Drains are drains." She poured water into a glass and sipped, then winced. "My head hurts. Maybe it's the wine."

"Or the coffee," I said. The words came out like a joke but landed like a confession.

The Japanese guy stirred his rice and lifted the lid to check. A puff of steam rose and curled into the air. For a second I imagined it was smoke, and my heart did a small jump. He set the lid down and turned the flame lower. The pilot light flickered, then steadied. The sound of the stove was a low whisper, a steady hush.

I set my mug on the table and took out my phone. The tiles looked incredible in the noon light, the patterns sharp as ink. I took a quick shot of the pot of rice against the blue wall, a candid moment that would make a nice story. I didn't tag him. I didn't ask permission. Content is a parasite like that.

The Brazilian girl leaned against the counter and fanned her face. "Is there a window?" she asked.

I pointed at the painted shut one. "It doesn't open."

She pressed her palm to it and pushed. The window didn't move. "Of course," she said.

The Japanese guy nodded toward the courtyard door. "We can open that?"

"Only if you like your light ruined," I said, then smiled to soften it. I was half joking and fully serious. The light was the whole reason the kitchen existed in my head.

He went to the door anyway and pulled it open. Cool air slid in like a quiet reprimand. The smell thinned immediately. The tiles lost a little of their glow. I wanted to close the door. I didn't. I didn't want to be the villain in a room full of strangers.

"Better," the Brazilian girl said, and smiled at me, grateful.

I watched the doorway and tried to tell myself this was fine. I took another shot, cropped out the open door, edited the colors warmer, made the air look like it felt. When I posted it, I wrote *Lisbon kitchens are all charm and chaos.* The likes came in. The smell stayed outside the frame.

---

In the afternoon, I went out for a walk because the air inside was making my head feel like a balloon. Lisbon was kinder than the hostel. The streets smelled like grilled sardines and diesel and the ocean. The sun warmed the backs of my legs as I climbed a steep lane, the cobblestones uneven under my cheap heels. A yellow tram rattled past, so close I could feel the wind of it on my face. I caught the tram in a photo and posted it with a caption about getting lost because that always performed well.

I stopped at a small plaza and sat on a bench beneath a jacaranda tree. The leaves had started to fall, purple flowers drying to brown. I watched an older couple share a pastel de nata, the man brushing sugar off the woman's chin like it was the most normal thing in the world. I tried to imagine having a person like that, someone who knew you when you were not a brand. The thought felt indulgent and dangerous.

My phone buzzed again. This time it was my mother. I stared at the screen until it went dark. Then it buzzed again. I let it go to voicemail. A minute later a text came in: *Call me when you can. Your dad is worried.*

I felt the familiar prick of shame. I told myself I would call later, when I had good news, when I had a brand deal to announce, when I could sound like I was winning. I put the phone back in my bag and took another photo of the plaza.

On the way back to the hostel, I passed a hardware store. The open door let out a smell of metal and dust and paint. In the window, a rack of small gas detectors hung like cheap ornaments, bright white plastic with tiny green lights. I stopped and stared for a second. The price tag said 14,99. A part of me considered walking in and buying one, plugging it into the kitchen wall, being the hero. The idea lasted maybe five seconds. Then I imagined the comments: *So extra.* *Fake.* *Who do you think you are?* I kept walking.

When I got back, the courtyard was full of people smoking. Dylan leaned against the lemon tree, shirtless, a beer in his hand, a cigarette in the other. His skin was sun-tanned in the way that meant he had money or no job. He saw me and lifted his beer in greeting.

"You look like you fought the hills and lost," he said.

"Lisbon is a personal attack," I said, and sat on the edge of a planter.

He flicked his cigarette. "At least the air out here doesn't smell like a gas station."

I laughed. "Don't say that too loudly. The kitchen might hear you."

"It should," he said. He inhaled, held it, exhaled a thin stream of smoke that curled up into the lemon leaves. "You smoke?"

"For photos," I said.

"That's worse," he said. "At least when I smoke it's for my sins."

I smiled. "Everything is for a reason," I said.

He tipped his head. "Your reasons are on a screen though." He glanced at my phone. "Still doing the morning shot tomorrow?"

"Yeah," I said. "Last one. Then I'm done."

He nodded like he didn't believe me. "Just do it outside. Light it out here, go in with it lit."

"That ruins it," I said, and he laughed.

"The light is good inside though," he said. "Those tiles are insane." He took another drag, then gestured toward the kitchen door. "But it really does smell like gas. I told Pedro. He said it was the drains."

"Everything is the drains," I said. We both laughed, but it sounded a little too sharp.

A girl from the Brazilian group joined us, her hair in a high ponytail, her phone in her hand. "Sienna, can you film a little thing for our story?" she asked. "We love your vibe."

"Sure," I said, because that was my default setting. I stood, smoothed my hair, and did a quick video of us clinking beer bottles in the courtyard. She posted it instantly, tagged me, and I watched the notification pop up. A small dopamine hit, a tiny proof that I existed.

Later, when the courtyard emptied, I went up to the rooftop. The wind was colder than I expected, the city lights flickering on below like a circuit board. I could hear Tram 28 clattering along its track, the sound echoing up the hill. I leaned on the railing and looked out at the river, dark and flat, reflecting the last orange of the sunset.

Felix appeared beside me, camera slung around his neck. "You missed a good shot at the market," he said.

"I missed my mother calling," I said, and laughed to make it a joke.

He glanced at me. "You should call her."

"I will," I said. I did not say when.

He lifted his camera and took a photo of the skyline. "This city feels like a postcard that got wet," he said. "Still beautiful, but you can see the paper."

"That's poetic," I said.

"That's tired," he said, and smiled.

We stood in silence for a while. The string lights above us swayed, little bulbs glimmering like warnings. Somewhere below, someone laughed too loudly, the sound rising up the stairwell like smoke.

"You really going to light it?" he asked finally.

"Tomorrow," I said.

He nodded, then said, "I lost a friend in a studio fire in Berlin. Candle. Old wiring. He thought it was nothing." His voice was casual, but his hands tightened on the camera strap. "Just... be smart."

"Smart doesn't trend," I said, and regretted it immediately.

He winced, the way someone does when a joke lands wrong. "You'll trend just fine without burning," he said.

I smiled and looked away. The river was dark, the boats tiny. The night smelled like salt and smoke and the faint sweetness of the gas that followed me even up here, like it was stuck in my hair.

When I went back to the dorm, I found Jessa's bed empty, the sheets neatly folded. The space she had taken was a clean rectangle of air. I sat on my mattress and opened my bank app. The number glowed red. I closed it. I opened Instagram instead and watched my follower count tick up by three. It felt like winning a scratch card and losing your wallet in the same day.

I finally called my mother. She answered on the second ring, breathless.

"Sienna?" she said.

"Hi," I said. My throat tightened. I looked at the ceiling to stop the tears.

"Where are you?" she asked.

"Lisbon," I said. "It's beautiful."

"Your dad saw on the news about a fire in Porto," she said quickly. "Are you safe?"

"It's Porto," I said. "Different city."

"Still Portugal," she said, as if the entire country was a single burning building. "I wish you'd come home."

"I can't," I said. "I'm working."

"On what?" She tried to make it sound casual. It was not casual.

"Content," I said, and hated the word even as it came out. "It's good, Mum. I'm doing well."

There was a pause, long enough to hear my father in the background asking if it was me. "We just worry," she said. "You sound tired."

"I'm fine," I said, because that's what daughters say when they are not.

"Are you eating?"

"Yes," I said. I had eaten a pastel de nata and three peanuts.

"Are you safe?"

I thought of the kitchen. The smell. The lighter on my pillow. I thought of Jessa leaving, Joana's tight smile, Maria crossing herself. I thought of the free nights and the brand deal and the way the light had looked on the tiles this morning.

"Yes," I said. It came out too fast.

She sighed. "Call me tomorrow."

"I will," I said. I did not say when.

We said goodbye, and I put the phone down. My hands were shaking. I told myself it was from caffeine.

I laid out my clothes for the morning. I set my ring light on the floor. I placed the red lighter next to my phone, the way people place jewelry before a wedding. I opened the window a crack and let the night air in, cold and clean. It barely pushed the smell back, but it was something.

I lay down with the lighter on the pillow beside me. The room was dark, the other girls asleep, their breaths a chorus. The gas smell from downstairs was faint but persistent, like a memory you can't shake. I stared at the ceiling and tried to imagine the morning light in the kitchen, the way it would catch the steam, the way it would make the tiles look like a postcard someone had lit from behind.

I told myself it would be quick. I told myself it would be worth it. I told myself that after this, I would stop.

Downstairs, the building settled, a slow creak like a body adjusting in bed. Somewhere behind the stove, a soft hiss threaded through the silence, steady and patient. I closed my eyes and listened to it like it was a lullaby.

Tomorrow, I thought. Just one more shot.
