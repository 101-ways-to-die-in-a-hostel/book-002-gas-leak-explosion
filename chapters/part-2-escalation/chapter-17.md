# Chapter 17: The Air Doesn't Blink

The lighter sparked. The room didn't.

For half a second I waited for the universe to split, for the white flash, for the noise that would make all other sounds a joke. The spark was small and blue and shy. It kissed the wick and died. No flame. No roar. No permission.

I exhaled, and the exhale tasted like coins.

My thumb went back to the wheel because the shot was already running and because I had already told myself I would do this. Another flick. Another blink of blue. Nothing. The lighter felt heavier than it should, the kind of heavy that means empty.

I laughed, a little too loud in the sleeping hostel. It came out like a cough. The ring light hummed. The camera kept recording my face in perfect light while my brain did a messy little prayer to a brand.

The hiss behind the stove kept going, steady as a metronome. If the lighter had lit, if the flame had caught, maybe I would have been the first to understand. But the lighter didn't. The lighter chose me instead.

I tapped it against the table, like that would convince it. The cigarette sagged between my lips, stale and soft. I set it down, lifted the lighter to my ear, shook it. A dry rattle, no slosh. Out.

A footstep in the hallway. A soft creak that made my stomach yank. I snatched the cigarette and the lighter off the table, killed the ring light, and sat very still, my hands hidden under the table like a child caught with sweets.

The door opened and the light from the hallway cut a thin line across the tiles.

"Sienna?" Joana's voice. Sleepy, suspicious.

"Yeah?" I tried to sound casual, which is always a mistake.

She stepped in, braid loose, hoodie on, rubbing her eyes. She blinked when she saw the table, the phone, the ring light cord. The cigarette was tucked between my fingers below the tabletop. She could smell it anyway. The gas was stronger, but smoke has its own guilt.

"It's early," she said.

"I couldn't sleep." I shrugged like that explained why I was in the kitchen with a ring light at six in the morning.

She looked toward the stove, toward the back wall, toward the floor like she was listening to the building breathe. "You shouldn't be here," she said, and there was no comedy in it now. "We are waiting for the gas company. It is not safe. Not safe for you, not safe for me, not safe for anyone. Please."

"I know," I said, and even as I said it I could hear the lie in my voice. I did not know. I knew just enough to be stupid.

She rubbed her forehead. "You smell it, right?"

"Yeah," I said, and this time it was the truth. The smell was thick enough to feel like a fabric, like you could cut it and fold it and make a joke about it in a story.

"I called them again," she said. "They said today. Maybe. Always maybe."

I nodded, eyes on the tiles because I could not look at her and hold the guilt and the light at the same time.

"If you feel dizzy, go outside." Her voice softened. "Please don't light anything. Not even a candle."

"I'm not lighting," I said too fast, and she looked at the cigarette in my hand like it was a language she had just learned.

"Okay." She pulled the door a little wider, letting in the cooler air from the hallway. The smell shifted but didn't leave. "Please sleep. And put the sign back on the door." She didn't wait for an answer. She left, her footsteps fading as she climbed the stairs, and I sat there in the blue light of the tiles feeling like a child who had been told not to touch a hot stove.

I put the sign back on the door. I told myself that was the responsible part. I told myself the lighter being empty was a sign, not just a mechanical problem. I told myself that if I bought a new lighter, it would be a moral choice, not just a purchase.

Outside, the sky was bruised with early light, Lisbon yawning. The lemon tree smelled clean. I opened the courtyard door and breathed the air like it was a favor someone owed me. The gas smell clung to my hair anyway, a ghost with a good memory.

I went upstairs and crawled back into bed, the ring light buzzing in my head. I scrolled the footage from the camera. The shot was useless. You could see my mouth and the cigarette, but the flame never came. It looked like a tease without payoff. The brand rep wanted smoke, and all I had was a girl in perfect light holding an unlit prop and a face that briefly looked afraid.

I deleted the clip. I didn't delete the moment.

---

By nine, the hostel was awake. The kitchen sign was back on the door, the same curled paper with the same plea no one wanted to read. People drifted in anyway, one by one, like moths to a light they knew was dangerous. The smell was everywhere now, faint in the hallways, heavier near the stairs, thick and sweet in the kitchen.

The front desk phone rang on a loop. Joana answered it, on hold for ten minutes, answered again. The line between her brows deepened. Pedro never showed his face. The wall behind him might as well have been his body.

I went out for coffee because I told myself the air outside would rinse me. The sun was up, the city warm, the streets already crowded with tourists who didn't know which way was down. I bought a coffee I didn't need and sat on a low wall, letting the heat collect on my thighs. The cafe had a ceramic ashtray on the table. It was the size of my palm. It smelled like old cigarettes and sugar. I wanted to take a photo of it. I didn't. The brand didn't ask for ashtrays. The brand asked for smoke.

A man at the kiosk near the tram stop sold postcards, gum, and lighters. The lighters were lined up like bright little lies. I told myself I would buy one just in case. I told myself it was better to be prepared. I told myself I could use it for candles on my birthday. I bought the red one.

The man slid it across the counter, and when our fingers brushed his skin was colder than mine. "Nao fumar," he said, nodding at the no smoking sign in the kiosk window. He smiled like it was a joke.

I smiled back. "I know."

In the hostel lobby, someone had pinned a flyer in Portuguese about gas safety. It showed a cartoon family smiling as they opened windows. It was adorable in the way that safety can be when it is not real yet. I took a picture of it because the irony had teeth. I captioned it in my drafts: *When the building tries to kill you, remember to open a window.* I didn't post it. I was afraid of being too honest.

Upstairs, Jessa was sitting on the bunk with her knees to her chest, drawing in her notebook. Her hair was a halo of black fuzz around her head. She looked up when I came in, nostrils flaring like she had been waiting for the smell to arrive.

"You smell like gas," she said.

"The building smells like gas," I said.

"You still went down there." She didn't ask it like a question.

"Just for a second." I dropped my bag and slid the lighter into my toiletry pouch where it wouldn't glare at me.

"Sienna." She said my name like a warning. "This isn't a bit."

"I know," I said, because saying it was easier than acting like I knew it. "It's just... the light is so good.

"The light isn't going anywhere," she said. "You are."

I laughed because if I didn't, I would have had to sit in the truth of it. "You sound like a fortune cookie."

She smirked, but her eyes stayed serious. "I'm not trying to be your mom. I'm trying to be your friend."

I nodded and looked away because there are only so many versions of myself I can be at once. In my phone, I was a girl with a clean kitchen and soft smoke. In the room, I was a girl with a headache and a cheap lighter and a fear she didn't know how to name.

We went downstairs together. The kitchen door was propped open, the sign flapping like a desperate mouth. Inside, Maria was sweeping the tile, muttering under her breath. She crossed herself when we walked in.

"Hoje e mau," she said. "Bad today."

"We are not cooking," Joana said, stepping in behind us. Her voice was thin. "Please. The gas company is coming."

"They said that yesterday," Lucas muttered, leaning against the counter with a plate of bread. He had the air of someone who has already decided that rules are optional if everyone breaks them. He sniffed and made a face. "It is getting worse."

Joana's mouth tightened. "I know."

The hiss behind the stove was loud enough to hear over conversation now, a steady whisper that sounded like the building was exhaling. The dead plant in the corner had become a brown skeleton. Someone had put a fresh glass of water beside it like a joke or a memorial.

I poured myself water, taking shallow breaths. My head felt floaty, like I had stood up too fast. The room tilted again, just a hair. I caught the edge of the table and told myself it was just hunger.

Felix walked in, camera strap cutting across his chest. He saw my hand on the table and frowned. "You're pale," he said.

"I didn't sleep," I said.

"Gas makes you lightheaded," he said, the way you might say rain makes you wet. "You should go out."

I didn't answer. The water tasted metallic. I set the glass down and stared at it until the shimmer stopped.

Pedro finally appeared, moving fast, greeting a group of new arrivals with a smile that didn't touch his eyes. He didn't look at the kitchen. He looked at my phone when it buzzed, like he could see the brand email through my face.

"We are safe," he said, as if announcing it would make it true. "Everything is under control." He said it in English, in Portuguese, in Spanish, like a person reading a script to a crowd that had already seen the ending.

Joana watched him with a stillness that felt dangerous. "They haven't come," she said. "We cannot pretend."

"We can, and we will," he said. "We cannot close the kitchen. People paid for a kitchen."

"People paid for a bed," she said. "And for their lungs."

He shrugged, a small roll of the shoulders that felt like throwing a coin at a problem. "It's fine." He looked at me then, like he wanted me to agree. The influencer nod as endorsement. The light as alibi.

I smiled in the way I am trained to, not sure who I was smiling for. Pedro clapped his hands once and walked away.

Rafa came in that afternoon with a bag of pastries and a full-face of makeup already done. "We should shoot outside," she said immediately, like she had been practicing. "The light on the rooftop is insane and no one can complain about the rules."

"I need the tiles," I said.

She held up a pastel de nata like an offering. "Sienna. The tiles are not worth your eyebrows."

"It is not about the tiles," I snapped, and then softened because her face fell. "Okay. It's kind of about the tiles."

She sighed and sat on the table, legs swinging. "You are going to be on a true crime podcast if you keep this up."

"That would be good for the algorithm," I said, and we both laughed because the joke was sharp enough to be true.

She leaned in. "Please. Don't do it alone."

I wanted to promise, but the truth in me was stubborn and mean. "If I can get it done fast, it's safer," I said.

"That's not how gas works." Her voice was small, tired. "Gas doesn't care about your time management."

A new message buzzed on my phone. The brand rep again. *Need final footage today. No extensions.* The words sat on the screen like a deadline with teeth. I closed the message without answering. I could feel the heat of it on my palm.

The afternoon dragged. The smell did not. It settled into everything, into clothes, into hair, into the bread. I ate a pastel de nata and tasted gas between the sugar layers. I went to the courtyard for air and smelled it anyway. The courtyard lemon tree was dropping leaves. The sky was blue. It should have been enough. It wasn't.

I left the hostel because I had to pretend I was living, not just surviving a leak. I wandered toward the river, camera in hand, filming the tram as it climbed and squealed. The sunlight on the Tagus was blinding, a sheet of hammered gold. It was the kind of light that makes you believe you can be reborn if you stand in it long enough.

At a street kiosk, a woman sold roasted chestnuts from a cart that smoked like a tiny engine. She scooped them into a paper cone and the smoke curled around her fingers. She caught me staring and lifted her chin. "You look sick," she said in Portuguese, slow enough for me to understand. I smiled and pretended to be a tourist instead of a girl who lived on the internet.

"Just tired," I said.

She shrugged. "Lisbon makes you tired. Or something else." She nodded at my hair, the way the smell had soaked into it. "You smell like gas."

My stomach dropped. "Old building," I said, the phrase a reflex now.

She made a face. "Old doesn't mean safe." She handed me the chestnuts and turned away. It wasn't advice. It was a verdict.

I walked along the river with hot paper in my hands, eating the chestnuts as if they could scrub the smell out of my mouth. The smoke from the cart had been clean, the kind of smoke that meant warmth and autumn, not danger. I filmed the crumbs falling into the water and told myself I might use it as B-roll. I probably would not. The brand wanted a kitchen, not a river.

My phone buzzed. My mother again. I let it ring to the end and then called back because I am weak in very specific ways.

"Hey," she said, and her voice was careful, like she was trying not to spook me. "How's the wifi?"

I laughed. "That's your question?"

"It's the only one you answer," she said. "Are you eating?"

"Sometimes."

She paused. "You look thin in your stories."

I looked down at my hands, the bones at the base of my thumbs, the way my rings were looser than last month. "Filters," I lied.

"You're not in a hostel with... a gas smell, right?" she asked. She said it gently, but I could hear the worry in the spaces between her words.

"It's fine," I said. "They're fixing it."

"Who is 'they'?"

I opened my mouth and closed it. I didn't know if there was a they. There was just Joana and her phone and Pedro and his shrug.

"They," I said again, softer.

She sighed. "If it feels wrong, you leave. I don't care about the money. I don't care about your photos. I care about you."

The word you was heavy. I wanted to say I care about me too, but the truth is I cared about the person I performed as, the one who looked fearless in a feed. I cared about her more than the girl holding a phone on a windy riverbank.

"I know," I said, and it was the closest I could get.

"Just... don't be stupid," she said. I could hear her smiling through it, trying to make it light.

I smiled too. "I'm never stupid."

She laughed, and the sound made my eyes sting. I hung up before the sting could turn into something else.

When I walked back up the hill toward the hostel, I passed a television in a cafe window. The screen showed footage of firefighters in another city, hoses arcing into a building. The caption in Portuguese read something about an apartment fire caused by a candle. The flames looked small on screen, manageable. It made me feel reckless for a second, like maybe fire was ordinary, like maybe I was inventing a drama because I wanted to be interesting.

By the time I reached the hostel, the sun had slid lower and the light was stretching long. I should have felt better from the walk, from the air. Instead the headache had sharpened, a needle behind my eyes. I could smell the kitchen from the street. It shouldn't have been possible. I told myself it was in my head. I told myself a lot of things.

Jessa found me in the courtyard and handed me a cup of tea from the cafe down the street. "This is the part where I tell you to leave," she said.

"And I say no?"

She nodded. "And you say no."

"I can't," I said, which was not entirely true. I could. I just didn't know how to be the person who chooses to. "I have to deliver this."

"Deliver what?" she asked, and there was a gentleness there that made my throat tighten. "A picture of you with a cigarette?"

"It's a job," I said, and my voice cracked. "You wouldn't get it."

She raised an eyebrow. "Try me."

I stared at the tea in my hands, at the steam rising like a small ghost. "If I don't do this, I go home. I go back to a bedroom that smells like my dad's disappointment. I go back to being a girl who almost did something, who almost left."

"And if you do this," she said softly, "you might not go home at all."

We sat in the quiet for a moment, the lemon tree above us ticking leaves onto the ground. Somewhere inside, a door slammed. The sound felt like a punctuation mark.

"You sound like my mother," I said.

She smiled. "She sounds smart."

I laughed because if I didn't, I would cry. I wasn't ready for that. I never am.

---

By night, the hostel buzzed with the usual rhythm, people spilling onto the rooftop with beers and phones, string lights making everyone look softer than they felt. The kitchen door was still propped open. The sign was still ignored. The hiss was still there, relentless and bored.

I went down to fill my bottle before heading up, a small act of obedience to hydration that I could pretend was self-care. The kitchen smelled like a chemical bakery, sweet and wrong. Yuki was there with a pot of rice again, her shoulders tight. She glanced at me and then at the stove, as if we were both waiting for it to speak.

"It is worse," she said softly.

"I know." I held my bottle under the tap and watched the stream, trying not to breathe too deep.

Lucas came in, rubbing his eyes. He muttered something under his breath in Portuguese that I didn't understand, then pointed at the stove. "Hear that?" he asked.

The hiss rose and fell, a small tide. Beneath it, a faint clicking, the sound of a pilot light failing to catch. The stove made a tired little pop. Yuki flinched.

"Maybe we should not use it," she said.

"We shouldn't," Lucas said. He didn't move. None of us did. We were three people in a kitchen pretending the rules were for other people.

Joana appeared in the doorway, taking in the scene with the look of someone who has asked the same question too many times. "Out," she said. No apology. Just the word.

Yuki turned off the burner and lifted the pot, moving carefully like she was carrying a sleeping animal. Lucas took his water and left. I capped my bottle and followed, the air clinging to the back of my throat like syrup.

In the hallway, I leaned against the wall for a second, waiting for the dizziness to pass. It didn't feel like panic. It felt like being on a slow boat. I thought of the cartoon family on the gas safety flyer, smiling as they opened windows. I thought of my own face in the ring light, smiling as I closed doors.

I went up to the roof with Rafa and Felix. The city was a grid of amber lights, the river a dark ribbon. The air tasted clean up here, like it had never been inside. We took photos anyway, because it was my job and because I didn't know what else to do with a beautiful view and an audience.

Felix took a shot of me leaning against the railing. He edited it on the spot, boosting the shadows until my eyes looked deeper than they felt. I posted it with a caption about being on top of the world. Comments came fast. *Queen.* *Goals.* *Living.* Each heart was a small payment on a debt I couldn't name.

Rafa leaned into me, shoulder to shoulder. "You don't have to do it," she said, low, so Felix couldn't hear.

"I do," I said, because I had already made the decision by not making it.

She sighed and didn't argue. "If you insist, do it at dawn. We can get in, shoot, leave. I will be there."

"You don't have to be there," I said.

"I know," she said. "But I'm going to be."

Her loyalty felt like a gift I didn't deserve. I hated it. I loved it. I was too tired to choose between those feelings.

When I went back downstairs, the kitchen was empty and dark. The tiles glowed faintly in the moonlight. The smell was a dull punch. I stood in the doorway, the sign in my hand, and thought about closing it. I didn't.

In the dorm, Jessa was already asleep, her face soft, her mouth slightly open. The room was quiet, except for the fan clicking in the corner. I crawled into my bunk and stared at the ceiling. The lighter in my toiletry bag felt like a weight.

I opened it, flicked it once just to see. A clean flame rose, perfect and steady. It made a small sound, a soft hush, as if it were exhaling. I watched it for a second too long, then snapped it shut. The smell of butane mixed with the gas in the room and made my stomach drop.

I opened my phone and saw a new notification. A comment on my rooftop post from an account with no photo and a name made of numbers. *The light is hungry too.*

I stared at it until the screen dimmed. I wanted to reply. I wanted to ask who it was. I wanted to throw my phone out the window. I did none of those things. I locked the screen and held it against my chest like a shield.

My alarm was already set for 5:55. I set another for 6:10, because I have learned that one alarm is not enough. I set a third for 6:20, because I like to pretend I have control.

The gas smell was stronger upstairs now, like the building was exhaling into our room. I pulled the blanket over my head and breathed through the cotton, pretending it was a filter. I could hear someone coughing in their sleep. I could hear the old wood settle. I could hear the hiss in my head even when the kitchen was two floors away.

I told myself the gas company would come in the morning. I told myself I would see the truck and laugh and cancel the shoot. I told myself a lot of things, and the only one that felt solid was the lighter in my bag.

When I closed my eyes, I could see the tiles, the ring light, the red dot recording my face. I could see the flame, small and obedient. I could see the light doing what it always does, opening its teeth.

I slept like a person on a train, shallow and tense, dreaming of a kitchen that blinked and never looked away.
