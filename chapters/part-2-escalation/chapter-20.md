# Chapter 20: The Notice That Screams

When I opened my eyes, Joana was in the doorway with a fire extinguisher and a face that said I was already dead.

She didn't shout. She didn't need to. The hiss behind the stove did it for her.

"Out," she said. Her voice was small, but her grip on the extinguisher was white-knuckled.

I froze with the lighter still raised. The cigarette sat between my lips like a prop that had forgotten it was also poison. The ring light hummed, the camera blinked, and in the screen I looked like a girl about to start a tutorial.

"Sienna." Joana stepped into the kitchen. The floorboards creaked under her, and the sound ran through me like a warning. "Now."

I set the lighter down as if it were a bug I didn't want to kill. The air tasted like pennies and bad eggs. My head felt buoyant, detached. The tiles glowed with false daylight. I wanted to keep the shot, to keep the moment, to keep my last chance. My body wanted to breathe.

"Someone's coming," she said, and when she said it I believed her. "The gas company. They called me back. They are five minutes away." She glanced at the ring light. "If they see this, they will close everything."

"They're going to close it anyway," I said. My voice was flat. I didn't know if I was answering her or the part of me that was still standing in front of a camera.

She grabbed my wrist. Her hand was warm and shook. "I don't care about the kitchen. I care about you not being in a fireball."

It was the closest thing to affection she'd shown me, and it hit harder than the smell. I swallowed. The cigarette felt suddenly obscene. I pulled it from my lips and stuffed it in my pocket like a secret.

Rafa appeared in the doorway behind her, hair messily knotted, eyes wide. "I heard you," she said, and I couldn't tell if it was relief or anger.

"She was just leaving," Joana said, and pulled me toward the hall.

The kitchen sighed behind us as if it were disappointed.

In the hallway, the air was cooler, but my skin still prickled as if heat lived in it. Jessa poked her head out of the dorm with her hair in a sleep-knot, blinking like she'd woken inside a wrong dream.

"Why are you up?" she asked, then smelled the air and answered herself. "Oh. That." She pushed her door wider, staring past us toward the kitchen. "It's bad today."

"It's always bad," I said, and my voice came out brittle.

Jessa's eyes moved to the cigarette in my pocket, to my ring light case, to Joana's extinguisher. "You're not serious," she said.

I wanted to say no. I wanted to say I was just getting water, just existing. Instead I said, "It's for work," and the word felt like a cheap coat I kept putting on even though it didn't fit.

Jessa leaned against the doorframe, her face soft. "I used to say that about my ex," she said, and tried to smile. "He was also going to kill me in a very stupid way." She shrugged. "Go back to bed, Sienna. Or go outside. But don't go in there."

"Okay," I said, and it sounded like a lie because it was.

Joana glanced at me, then away. "He'll be here soon," she said, as if the gas man was a priest and we were in confession.

I didn't go back to bed. I went to the courtyard and wrapped my arms around myself. The lemon tree shivered. A cat hopped down from the wall and glared at me like I was interrupting its patrol. I inhaled the clean air and tried to feel grateful. All I could think about was light: the blue tiles, the ring light, the little flame the brand wanted, the golden hour I'd slept through yesterday. The city was waking up. A church bell rang, low and metallic, as if it was already tolling.

My phone buzzed in my hand. A new like, a new follow, a reel from a girl in Rome making coffee in a kitchen with no tape and no warning signs. I watched her clip, looped it once, then twice, my thumb hypnotized. The comments were full of little flames and hearts. It looked so easy, so safe, so fake. I watched her bring a lighter to a candle and thought about how the flame looked in her eyes.

"Don't," I whispered to myself, the word dissolving in the cool air.

---

By the time the gas company arrived, the kitchen had been emptied of anything that looked like a human choice. The ring light was gone, the phone tucked away, the espresso cup in the sink. There was no evidence of my almost-fire, only the air itself, thick and stale, like an unmade bed.

Two men in navy jackets came in with a clipboard and a yellow handheld device that looked like a film prop. One was older, with a grey moustache and a belly that strained his polo. The other was younger, neat, and kept glancing at his phone, as if he wanted to be anywhere else. They nodded at Joana, glanced at me, and went into the kitchen without a word.

Pedro appeared from the back room, his smile already dressed for the camera. "We are so grateful you came," he said in Portuguese, then in English, then again in Portuguese as if the repetition might soften the fact that he hadn't called them in the first place.

The older man did not smile back. He clicked on the device. It beeped at first, a tiny, polite sound like a microwave. Then it started to chirp, sharp and fast, and the light on its face went from green to orange to an aggressive red.

He held it near the stove, near the pipe, near the floor. The chirping turned into a constant alarm, the kind of sound that makes your teeth ache.

"Senhor Almeida," the man said, and it sounded like a verdict. He waved the device at the back of the stove. "There is a leak. A serious leak. The concentration is high. You must shut off the gas immediately."

Pedro's smile twitched. "But we have hot water," he said. "We have guests. They are already angry."

The younger man pulled a roll of red tape from his bag and started to cordon off the kitchen door. He was quick, practiced. The tape was glossy, the kind that appears in crime scenes and always makes your stomach drop.

"No," the older man said. "You will have angry guests. Or you will have dead guests. It is your choice. But now, the gas is off."

Pedro looked at Joana as if she had betrayed him. Joana stared at the floor.

I hovered near the hallway, trying to look like a person who belonged there. The alarm from the handheld device kept screaming, a tiny mechanical panic in the midst of our human one. The smell of gas was so strong now that my eyes watered. The air felt thick, almost damp.

The younger man crouched and waved the device along the tiles, and the numbers on its tiny screen flickered like a heart monitor. I couldn't read them, but his face told me enough. He grimaced, then stood, wiping his palm on his trousers. "It is pooled low," he said in Portuguese to the older man. "By the floor."

"Propane is heavy," the older man said, switching into slow English as if I needed the translation. He glanced at me again. "It stays low. It hides. If you are sitting, it is in your lungs before you smell it."

I tried to imagine the gas as a pet, a low fog curling around my ankles, waiting. I imagined myself kneeling to frame a shot and breathing it in like incense. My stomach twisted. I smiled anyway, a reflex, because my face had been trained to look fine.

Pedro laughed too loudly. "We ventilate," he said, gesturing at the window that never opened. "There is a fan." He pointed at the exhaust fan, dead as a black eye.

The older man walked over, pressed the switch. Nothing happened. He raised his eyebrows in a way that was almost polite. Pedro's smile thinned.

"We will return with an inspector," the older man said. "We will check all pipes. Until then, the gas is off. If it is turned on, you are responsible for what happens." He lifted his clipboard and marked something. The pen scratched like a small knife.

Rafa touched my elbow. "This is it," she whispered. "We're done. We're leaving."

I nodded because it was the right answer and because it meant I didn't have to choose it out loud.

The older man walked back into the hallway, cutting his tape across the door in an X and slapping a yellow notice in the center. He wrote something in Portuguese with a black marker, then switched to English beneath it.

**DANGER: GAS LEAK. DO NOT ENTER. DO NOT USE ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT. NO FLAMES. EVACUATE IF SMELL PERSISTS.**

The letters bled a little in the humidity. He stepped back and surveyed his work. The kitchen looked like a crime scene now. The blue tiles had a red border, a warning against their own beauty.

I read the sign twice. The word *evacuate* sat there like a dare. I looked around at the guests milling in the hallway, at a German couple with wet hair and towels, at a guy in flip-flops pouring cereal into a bowl with a face that said he had already decided he was not going anywhere.

"We will fix it today," Pedro announced, in the bright voice he used for check-in. "Please, do not worry. The gas is off. We are safe."

The older man shook his head. "We are not fixing it today. We are shutting it off. Your system is old. It needs inspection. The pipes are corroded. It is not safe." He glanced at me and softened a fraction. "If you smell gas, you leave the building."

"Okay," I said, because he was looking at me and because saying it felt like a spell I could use later.

"Do you smell gas now?" he asked.

I opened my mouth to answer, and the air filled it. It tasted like the idea of a match. It smelled like the inside of a broken battery. It felt like guilt. I nodded, because lying would have been too obvious.

"Then leave," he said, and his voice was tired.

Pedro laughed lightly, as if the man had made a joke. "She will be fine. She is just nervous." He clapped me on the shoulder again, his hand heavy, his ring cool. "Please, enjoy your stay. The tiles are beautiful."

I wanted to bite him. I wanted to thank him for the shot. I did neither. I stepped back into the common room and watched as the men turned the gas valve in the back, a silent twist that somehow felt like a moral decision.

The hot water stopped within five minutes. The complaints started within ten.

By noon, the lobby sounded like an airport on a snow day. People hauled their luggage out and back in, undecided. A Swedish guy tried to barter with Pedro for a discount and got a shrug. A woman from Leeds made a show of packing, then unpacking, then repacking, her jaw set like a travel blogger doing a bit. Everyone was suddenly an expert on gas, on safety, on the way old buildings worked. Everyone was also still in their pajamas.

Joana moved between them with a clipboard, taking note of who wanted refunds, who wanted to stay, who wanted to fight. Her eyes were hollow, her mouth a tight line. When she passed me, she paused and asked, "Are you leaving?"

I opened my mouth to say yes. I closed it and said, "Maybe."

She nodded once, as if she had expected it. "Don't be in the kitchen," she said again, quiet, like a prayer.

In the courtyard, Maria sat on a plastic chair and smoked a cigarette, the smoke curling up and away like a soul escaping. I hesitated, then sat on the opposite chair. "You shouldn't smoke," I said, because it was a stupid thing to say and because it was the only thing my mouth knew how to say.

She laughed, a dry sound. "The pipe wants me dead and you tell me about my cigarette," she said. "You are funny." She flicked ash into a plant pot. "In my village, when a house smells like gas, we leave. We don't argue. We don't take pictures. We leave the door open for the saints." She looked at me, her eyes sharp. "You have saints?"

"Only in my feed," I said before I could stop myself. She didn't get the joke. I didn't either.

She tilted her head, studying me. "You are not brave," she said. "You are stubborn." Then she went back inside, leaving her cigarette to burn on the edge of the ashtray like a warning.

I walked to the bakery again, alone this time. The street smelled like diesel and sugar. The tram rattled by, its windows full of people taking photos. I bought a pastel de nata I didn't want and sat on the curb to eat it anyway, the custard too sweet, the pastry flaking into my lap. Across the street, a poster for a gas company safety campaign showed a happy family and the words Smell Gas? Leave Fast. I stared at it until my eyes blurred.

My phone buzzed. A notification: Your reel has been saved by 58 people. Fifty-eight people wanted to keep my breakfast in their pockets, and I wanted to keep a kitchen that might kill me. I laughed, a short bitter sound, and ate the last of the custard. The sugar stuck to my teeth. I couldn't taste anything else.

By late afternoon, I was back in the hostel, sitting on my bunk with my laptop open, editing footage from the roof. I boosted the saturation, softened my skin, brightened the tiles from yesterday, pretending it could all be fixed in post. Every clip looked wrong. Every clip needed the flame. My hands moved without me, dragging sliders, saving drafts, dreaming of a shot that would erase all the compromises.

---

The rest of the day was a chorus of inconveniences and denials.

The German couple argued with Pedro about their refund, the argument rising and falling like a ringtone. The French girl in the floral dress posted a story with the caption *Hostel drama* and a crying-laughing emoji. A guy with a laptop in the common room muttered about needing a shower for his Zoom call. The smell of gas lingered anyway, stubborn and faint, like a stain on a pillow. The older man from the gas company said it could take hours to clear. He advised we open windows. The windows were painted shut.

Rafa and I sat on the steps to the courtyard, watching people step over the red tape like it was a fashion accessory. The tape fluttered every time the door opened, the yellow notice bouncing against it like a stern heartbeat.

"This is the most explicit warning you could possibly get," Rafa said. "There's literally a sign."

"I know," I said.

"So why do you keep looking at the kitchen like it's a lover?"

I didn't answer. The kitchen was a lover and a stage and a cliff. It had everything I wanted and everything that wanted me gone. The tiles were still visible through the tape, catching the afternoon light. They were smug, perfect, so clean and blue that they looked like a Photoshop filter in real life. I hated them. I needed them.

My phone buzzed. I glanced down. It was the brand rep again.

*Where are we on the deliverable? Client needs to make a decision in 24 hours.*

A little weight pressed into my chest. I could almost see the red numbers in my bank app, marching upward like soldiers. I could almost hear my mother's voice in my head, the one I hadn't called in a month, telling me to come home and stop pretending.

Rafa leaned over to see the screen. Her mouth tightened. "They're going to drop you."

"Maybe," I said. The word tasted like relief and failure.

"We can go," she said. "We can move hostels. We can find a new backdrop. Lisbon is literally a city of tiles."

"Not this tile," I said before I could stop myself.

She stared at me. "It's a kitchen," she said. "It's a death trap."

"It's a set," I said. "It's a signature. It's what I promised."

"You promised them a photo," she said. "Not your life."

I wanted to argue. Instead I looked at the red tape, at the way it cut a line through the doorway. I imagined cutting it with my fingernail, stepping under it like a trespasser in my own story. The thought thrilled and sickened me. It felt like the way the lighter had felt in my palm.

A faint headache bloomed behind my eyes. I rubbed at it, pretending it was from the noise, not the gas. I told myself the warning was enough. I told myself I would leave if the smell got worse. I told myself a thousand little things, and the day crept on.

By late afternoon, the gas company men had gone. They left the valve off. They left their tape and their notice. They left me with a choice and an itch.

The sun dipped, and the hostel softened into evening. People moved to the rooftop, drinks in hand, music on someone's speaker. The smell of gas drifted in the hallways, a ghost no one wanted to acknowledge. The blue tiles glowed from the streetlamp outside, the light sliding across the kitchen door like a fingertip.

On the roof, the view was golden. The river caught fire in the distance. The trams turned into little yellow beads. Someone lit a cigarette and the flame jumped, tiny and safe in the open air. I watched it too long.

Dylan appeared with two plastic cups. "You look like you're plotting a crime," he said, offering one.

"Just content," I said, and took the cup.

He glanced at the kitchen door below us. "They taped it off, hey? That serious?"

"Apparently," I said.

He sipped his drink. "Mate, if someone puts tape on a door, that's usually your cue to not go through it."

"Unless you're the main character," I said, trying for a joke.

He laughed, but it was polite. "Main characters die too, you know."

The words landed heavier than he intended. I set my cup down and looked back at the roof. Someone had strung fairy lights across the terrace, their bulbs glowing warm against the darkening sky. They were taped to the railing with old electrical tape. A small sign in the corner said *Do not touch.* The wind made them sway.

"You okay?" he asked.

"Fine," I said, as always.

He nodded like he didn't believe me. "If you need anything, shout. I'm in the mixed dorm." He hesitated. "Just don't be a hero." He walked away before I could answer.

I watched him disappear down the stairs and felt a jolt of something sharp. He was right, and that was the problem. I didn't want to be a hero. I wanted to be a caption. I wanted to be a product.

Rafa found me near the edge, where the wind was cooler. She leaned in, her voice low. "I booked a place for us tomorrow night. Just in case."

"Okay," I said.

"It's in Alfama. It's cute. No gas." She tried to smile. "You'll like the light."

I nodded again. My head was already downstairs, in the kitchen, with the tape and the warning and the lighter in my pocket. The rooftop felt too safe, too open. The light was wrong. The tiles were downstairs.

---

I went down after midnight, when the roof emptied and the common room went quiet. The kitchen door was still taped shut, the notice flapping slightly when the air moved. The hallway was dark. The only light came from the exit sign and the glow of my phone.

The smell was fainter now, but it was there, a sour whisper. It had become part of the building, like the creak of the stairs or the way the pipes rattled. I touched the tape with my finger. It was cool and smooth. It felt official. It felt like a dare.

I could have turned around. I told myself that. I stood there for a full minute, thumb pressed against the tape, listening to my own breath.

The silence was thick. No hiss tonight. The gas was off. That made it safer, and it made it more dangerous, because it made me think there was nothing left to fear. It made the kitchen feel like a stage again, quiet and waiting.

I peeled the tape back. The sound was small, a soft rip that felt like it cut through the hallway. The notice fell sideways, its warning now useless on the wall. I stepped inside and let the door close behind me.

The kitchen was dim. The tiles were dark blue in the shadow. The window was a rectangle of black. I turned on the ring light and the room snapped back into my color palette. The light filled the space, sharp and beautiful. The tiles lit up like bones.

I didn't light anything. I didn't plug anything into the stove. I just stood there, looking, letting the room pour itself into my eyes. I took a few shots of the empty table, the cup, the spoon in the sink. I framed the warning notice on the wall behind me like a prop. I smiled into the camera, because I always did.

My phone buzzed once. Another message.

*@HostelReaper: When they tape the door, you cut the tape.*

The air in the kitchen went cold. I looked at the screen, at the words, at the little account that didn't have a face. My throat tightened. I blocked it again with shaking fingers. The screen went dark. The ring light hummed on.

I packed up and left the tape on the floor. I told myself I would fix it in the morning. I told myself I would never come back. I told myself that doing this once, without a flame, was enough to satisfy the brand. I told myself lies because the truth was heavy.

Back in the dorm, the air was stale. Jessa snored softly. Rafa slept on the bunk below me with one arm over her head. I lay in the dark and listened to the building settle, the pipes clicking, the distant hum of the city. The lighter sat on the bedside shelf like a question.

At 3:17 AM, I checked my messages again. The brand rep had sent a final note.

*Client wants the flame. We can do 50% upfront if you deliver by morning.*

My chest tightened. Fifty percent meant a month of rent, a buffer, a breath. Fifty percent meant I could keep being me for a little longer. I stared at the numbers in my bank app. I stared at the lighter.

Rafa shifted below me and muttered in her sleep. I reached down and touched the edge of her blanket like it could tether me to something better. It didn't.

I set my alarm for 5:40. I put the lighter in my hoodie pocket, so I would feel it when I woke. I closed my eyes.

The hallway was silent. The tape I had peeled back lay on the kitchen floor like shed skin. The gas valve was off. The warning was up, crooked. The rules were clear.

When my phone buzzed at 5:40, I sat up before I could think. The room smelled normal, like damp socks and detergent. The safety felt almost convincing. I pulled on my hoodie and felt the lighter press against my chest.

Outside the dorm, the hallway was cool and dark. The kitchen door stood at the end, its warning sign crooked, its tape hanging like a torn ribbon. The tiles waited behind it, blue and patient.

I took one step forward.
