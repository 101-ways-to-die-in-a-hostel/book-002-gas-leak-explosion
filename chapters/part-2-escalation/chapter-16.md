# Chapter 16: The Light Has Teeth

The lighter clicked and the room didn't explode. That should have been a relief. It wasn't. It just meant I was still in it.

My thumb hovered over the wheel, the red plastic warm against my palm. The ring light hummed. The phone blinked its red dot, a tiny witness. The hiss behind the stove was the only thing that felt alive, a steady exhale as if the building was breathing for me.

I flicked the wheel again. A brief spark, blue and shy, then nothing. My heart jerked like it had been hit. I held my breath, waiting for the roar, for the white. Nothing came. The air stayed thick and sweet, as if it had swallowed the flame.

"You don't light" didn't feel like a warning anymore. It felt like a dare.

A soft creak came from the hallway, a floorboard offering up its complaint. I froze with the lighter half-raised. The door handle turned.

"Hello?" a voice said. Male, sleepy. Dylan's drawl. He stepped into the kitchen in boxers and a hoodie, hair still standing up. He blinked into the ring light, squinted, then saw the cigarette in my hand. "Jesus, Sienna. It's like a police interview in here."

I forced a laugh. "Couldn't sleep."

He sniffed, then winced. "Smells like a chemistry set."

"Old building," I said. The lie came easy now. I set the lighter down fast, too fast, the clink on the table too loud. The cigarette trembled between my fingers. My hand shook like it belonged to someone else.

Dylan padded to the sink and filled his water bottle, coughing into the crook of his arm. "They still haven't fixed it?"

"They're coming tomorrow," I said. It was the word of the week, tomorrow, a cheap promise you can spend on anything. "I'm just getting a shot."

He raised an eyebrow. "At one in the morning?"

"Golden hour doesn't exist for me," I said. "I make my own."

He laughed, but it was tired. "You should make your own outside. This place is gross." He wiped his mouth on his sleeve. "They said no smoking in here, right?"

"I'm not smoking." I lifted the unlit cigarette like evidence. The ring light made it look longer and whiter, a prop in a staged crime.

"Still," he said. "With that smell, I wouldn't light anything. My aunt's kitchen went up like that. Dude lit a candle. Boom." He made a sound with his mouth, the childish version of an explosion.

I nodded, pretending I was listening and not calculating the angle of his body in the frame. He walked out, leaving the door half open. A thin line of cooler air slid into the room, thinning the smell by a fraction. The tiles lost their glow. The moment lost its magic.

I stared at the phone screen. The footage was running. My face looked serene, at least from this distance. The door in the frame was open now, the light ruined. I reached for it and closed it, then stopped. I opened it again. I couldn't decide which betrayal I preferred: bad light or bad air.

The lighter sat between my fingers, weightless and heavy. I clicked it once more. No flame. Maybe it was empty. Maybe it was mercy.

I set the lighter down and ended the recording. The red dot went dark. The silence that followed was worse than the hiss, a sudden awareness of how alone I was in that tiled room with a smell that didn't care about my plans.

I left the cigarette on the saucer, like an offering, and walked out.

---

The hallway smelled like gas too, just fainter, a whisper that followed me up the stairs. In the dorm, I slid into my bunk and pulled the blanket over my head as if cotton could filter air. The room felt too warm. My head throbbed with a dull, pulsing ache. I closed my eyes and the ring light made a ghost circle behind my lids.

My phone buzzed under the blanket. Another DM. *@HostelReaper: The light has teeth.*

I stared at the words until they blurred. My throat went dry. I told myself it was just someone who followed my stories and liked being creepy. I told myself trolls were everywhere, especially when you were visible. I told myself that if I blocked them, they'd disappear, like a stain wiped off the screen.

I didn't block them. I took a screenshot. I wasn't sure why. Evidence? Content? A weird part of me wanted to show Rafa and make it into a joke. Another part wanted to ask if the message was a warning or a threat. I did neither. I put the phone face down and waited for sleep to catch me. It didn't.

When I finally slept, I dreamed I was in the kitchen and the tiles were teeth, rows and rows of blue mouths opening and closing. The hiss was a breath between them. I woke with the taste of metal in my mouth and the smell of gas in my hair.

---

Morning was gray, the kind of light that makes everything look honest. I hated it.

The kitchen was already crowded when I went down. Yuki was at the stove with a pot of rice, Lucas leaning against the counter, and Joana hovering at the door like a chaperone. The courtyard door was propped open with the chair again. The air moved, but it didn't clean.

"Any word?" Lucas asked Joana.

She shook her head. "Not yet." Her voice was flat now, tired of asking. She had a phone in her hand and a list in her other, like a person trying to hold a sinking ship together with paperwork.

"Pedro?" Yuki asked, stirring the pot. Her English was careful, like she was walking on a slick floor.

Joana's mouth tightened. "Pedro says later. Always later." She didn't look at any of us when she said it, like she didn't want to see how much she was failing.

Lucas sniffed and grimaced. "It's getting worse."

Maria came in with her broom and crossed herself as she stepped onto the tile. "Today is bad," she said. "Today is very bad." She looked at the stove as if it might bite her. She swept quickly, her movements nervous, hurried.

I sat at the table and opened my phone, pretending to scroll. The smell pressed at my temples, and for a second I felt like I was underwater. I blinked hard and the room steadied.

"You okay?" Yuki asked. She had noticed my hand gripping the table.

"Fine," I said. It was a reflex, a habit. I smiled because that is how I survive.

Joana caught my eye. "Did you sleep in the kitchen?" she asked, tone light but eyes sharp. She had an uncanny sense of what I did when she wasn't looking.

"No," I said. The lie tasted sour. I couldn't stand the way her gaze held me. "I was just editing late."

She nodded, but her face said she didn't believe me. "Please don't be in there at night," she said. "If something happens, we can't help."

The word help landed heavier than she meant it to. I shrugged. "Nothing's going to happen."

"That's what Pedro says," Lucas muttered. He took a bite of his toast and chewed like it was punishment.

Joana set her phone down and rubbed her forehead. "We are closing the kitchen until the gas company comes," she said, louder now, to the room. "No cooking. No smoking. Please."

A few people grumbled. One guy in a soccer jersey laughed and said, "So where's breakfast?" The room reacted the way hostels always do, a wave of mild annoyance, nothing sharp enough to matter.

"Cafe," Joana said. She reached for a marker and wrote on a new sign. *Kitchen closed for safety.* The word safety looked small on the paper.

I felt my chest tighten. My light. My tiles. My shot. I could feel the brand email like a hand on my throat.

Rafa texted: *Any chance today?*

I looked at Joana taping the sign to the door. I looked at the courtyard door propped open. I looked at the back burner and the sign on it that said *FORA DE SERVICO - GAS.* I looked at the light, flat and gray and wrong.

*Not now,* I typed. *Maybe early?*

She replied with a skull emoji and a spark. She had a sense of humor I wasn't sure I deserved.

I left the kitchen and went outside into the courtyard. The lemon tree smelled like a clean knife. The air was cold, and it felt like forgiveness. I pressed my back against the wall and closed my eyes. I could still taste the gas when I swallowed. It had soaked into me.

Felix found me there, camera slung over his shoulder, his face already tightened against the smell leaking from the door. "They're closing it?" he asked.

"For now," I said.

"Good." He didn't wait for me to agree. "Come to the Miradouro with me. The light is insane. Real light. Not ring light."

I wanted to say yes, wanted to be the version of myself who said yes to real things. The other version spoke first. "I have to edit."

He looked at me like he wanted to shake me. "You look sick," he said.

"I'm just tired."

"Gas makes you tired," he said, echoing Maria, like the hostel was a chorus now. "And stupid."

I opened my mouth to argue and then closed it. I didn't have a good counter for truth. He shook his head and left, his steps slow, like he was dragging himself away from an accident in slow motion.

---

I drifted into the street and let the city do what the hostel couldn't. Lisbon had the kind of morning that makes you feel like you can start over. The cobblestones were slick with dew, the sky a soft gray, the trams clattering like a metal heartbeat. A bakery exhaled warm sugar and butter. I followed the smell and bought a pastel de nata I didn't need. I ate it standing under an azulejo street sign that said *Rua do Sol* and tried not to think about how good air could taste.

Across the street, a cafe television murmured in Portuguese. The footage was all flames and crumpled masonry, a kitchen blown open, the kind of scene you assume only happens in other countries, in other people's lives. The anchor said a word I knew: *explosao.* My stomach tightened. I looked away and focused on the crumbs in my hand, on the sun just beginning to warm my fingers.

My phone buzzed. My mother. I let it ring once, twice. On the third buzz I answered because guilt is louder than any hiss.

"Hi," she said, too bright, like she was trying to be the opposite of worried. "How's Lisbon?"

"Beautiful," I said. It was the only simple truth I had.

She paused. "You sound tired. Are you sleeping?"

"Busy," I said. "Brands."

"Mmm." The little sound she makes when she doesn't believe me. "There was something in your story about a smell. That's not... gas, is it?"

I blinked. I hadn't said it out loud. But mothers hear the things you leave out. "Old building," I said. "It's fine."

Silence stretched. Then she said, softly, "If it's not fine, leave."

I should have said I would. I should have told her I loved her. I said, "Battery's dying." It was a lie, and it landed between us like a dropped plate.

"Okay," she said. "Just be careful."

I hung up and stared at my phone. The battery was full.

When I got back to the hostel, Pedro was at reception, the first time I'd seen him in the flesh. He was shorter than I expected, with a neat beard and a shirt that said he wanted to look like a man who cared. He was flipping through a stack of printed reviews, his finger tapping the words *smell* and *gas* as if they were typos he could erase.

Joana stood across from him, arms crossed, jaw tight. "We need to close the kitchen until the inspection," she said.

"If we close it, people leave," he said. His voice was calm, practiced, the voice of someone who sells rooms for a living. "Then we lose money. Then we cannot fix anything."

"If we don't close it, people die," she said. She didn't raise her voice. She didn't have to.

Pedro sighed and rubbed his eyes. "You're being dramatic. It's just a smell. Old pipes." He said it like a spell, like a charm against consequence.

Joana looked past him and saw me. Her eyes hardened. "I told you. No one in the kitchen."

Pedro turned and followed her gaze. He smiled at me like a host. "Sienna, yes? You are the one with all the photos. We love your content. It helps us." He said it like a compliment and a warning.

By afternoon, the kitchen was technically closed. In practice, people still drifted in for water, for coffee, for a spoon. The door stayed open, the sign ignored. The air was still thick. It didn't care about rules.

I sat in the common room and edited footage from the night. The ring light made me look soft, a little haunted. The camera had captured a moment where I lowered the lighter and stared past it, my eyes unfocused. It was a real look. I hovered over it, thumb ready to delete. I didn't. Real is currency now.

A brand rep emailed again: *Need the lit shot. Deadline moved up. Tonight works?* The email was polite, but the subtext was a line drawn in sand. You deliver or you disappear.

I took a screenshot of the email and stared at it like it was a dare. Then I opened Instagram and watched a girl in Bali light a cigarette in a temple for a sponsored resort. The comments were a riot of hearts. She looked effortless. She looked alive.

I could do it. Ten seconds. It was always ten seconds.

I went back to the kitchen anyway, because gravity in this hostel seems to point toward those tiles. The sign on the door curled and flapped in the draft like it wanted to leave too. Inside, the smell was worse, sweeter, the kind of sweetness that makes your tongue go numb. The courtyard door was propped open, but it didn't matter. The air had settled in like a bad roommate.

The dead plant in the corner had finally given up, its leaves crisp and curled. Someone had stuck a fork in the soil as if to test if it could feel pain. The back burner tape had been peeled off and retaped in a different spot, a thin yellow band that did more to draw attention than to warn. The hiss behind the stove was louder, unembarrassed now.

Lucas was filling his bottle at the sink. He glanced at me and then at the sign on the door. "We are so bad at following rules," he said, like a confession.

"I just need my mug," I said. It wasn't true. I didn't need anything. I needed everything.

He sniffed and shook his head. "This isn't normal, you know. I lived in Rio. We had leaks. They were bad. This is... worse." He looked at the stove as if it might move. "You shouldn't be in here."

"I'm not cooking," I said.

"Gas doesn't care if you're cooking," he said, echoing Joana. Everyone was starting to say the same sentences. It was like the hostel had a script and I was the only one ignoring it.

Maria came in with her broom and stopped at the threshold, crossing herself. She saw me and shook her head. "Menina, you like this room too much," she said. The word menina sounded like a warning and a pity.

"I like the light," I said, and it felt too small to explain what I meant.

She swept, fast and angry. "Light doesn't help when the air is wrong," she said. She looked at the window, the one painted shut. "This window, I tell him, open it. He says no, people want the look. The look is killing us." Her broom hit the tiles harder, a small, futile violence.

I reached for my mug and the world tilted. Not much, just a small tilt, the way a boat tilts before you notice the wave. I steadied myself on the table, smiled so Lucas and Maria wouldn't look too closely.

"You need to eat," Maria said. "Gas makes you hungry and stupid."

"So does Instagram," Lucas said, and we all laughed because it was easier than admitting the room could hurt us.

I grabbed the mug and left the kitchen with the smell stuck to me. In the hallway, Joana was taping the sign back up. She looked at my hand, at the mug, at my face, and didn't say anything. Her silence felt like a door closing.

I took the mug to the common room and sat by the window, the only place the air felt less heavy. I tried to edit, but my eyes kept blurring. I kept rereading the brand email, the word *tonight* like a pulse. The money I needed was such a small number compared to the risk, and yet it felt huge. The number in my bank app was a cold hole. The number of followers I had felt like a warm blanket. I chose the blanket.

Rafa wandered in mid-afternoon, hair damp from a shower, ring light case in hand. She dropped into the chair across from me. "You look like a ghost," she said.

"Thanks," I said.

"I'm serious," she said. "You good?"

I opened my mouth and almost told her about the DM, about the weird feeling that the kitchen was watching me. Instead I said, "Just tired. The smell's giving me a headache."

She nodded. "It's giving everyone a headache. I told Joana we should all go to the rooftop and light a bonfire. At least that would be an honest fire."

I laughed, then stopped because the idea made my stomach twist. She noticed and softened. "Hey," she said. "We don't have to do it. We can fake the smoke. We can do it outside. We can do it anywhere."

"It won't be the same," I said. My voice came out sharper than I meant.

Rafa's mouth tightened. "It's always about the same with you," she said. She leaned back, eyeing me. "What happens if you don't get the shot?"

"I lose the deal," I said.

"And then?"

I didn't answer because there isn't a clean answer. There's just the long slide back to Essex, back to the room I used to be, the girl who didn't have a handle or a grid or a reason to wake up at 4:47. I looked away and Rafa let it go.

She got up to leave. "Just... don't be alone in there," she said, softer now. "Promise me."

"Promise," I lied.

The gas company still hadn't come by four. Joana stormed out of reception, phone pressed to her ear, speaking fast and sharp. I caught only fragments: *Nao e seguro*, *agora*, *tem pessoas*. She came back with her jaw clenched and taped another sign to the kitchen door. *DO NOT USE. GAS LEAK.* This time, in English and Portuguese, in block letters, no charm.

I stared at it as I walked past. The sign looked like a frame. The word leak looked like a tear.

My phone buzzed. Another DM. *@HostelReaper: You won't need the filter when the light comes.*

My fingers went cold. I took another screenshot, then opened the profile. Blank. No posts. A gray avatar. The kind of account that could be anyone. I blocked it this time. The block felt like a weak charm against something I couldn't name.

I went to the bathroom and splashed water on my face. In the mirror, my skin looked pale, almost gray. I smiled to test it. It looked like a rehearsal. I put on lip gloss anyway. If I looked fine, I could be fine. I was very good at this logic.

---

Night fell and the hostel filled with its usual noise: flip-flops slapping the stairs, laughter in a dozen languages, the clink of bottles on the rooftop. The kitchen sign was still there, but the door was open. The air of the place throbbed with normalcy, the kind you get right before a storm.

I sat on my bunk with my phone, scrolling through the brand brief for the hundredth time. It wanted "casual", "effortless", "European morning ritual." It wanted smoke. It wanted the thing that made my stomach tighten.

Rafa called. Her voice was a whisper, like she was already in bed. "You doing it?"

"Maybe," I said.

"Do it at dawn if you're going to," she said. "Less people. Cooler air. We can get in, get out. Ten seconds."

"Okay," I said. My mouth was dry. "Okay."

She sighed. "Don't be stupid."

"I'm never stupid," I said, and we both laughed because it was the kind of joke that keeps you from admitting things.

After the call, I set my alarm for 5:55. I laid the lighter on the nightstand like a talisman. The cigarette beside it looked small and harmless, a white dash of possibility.

I turned off the light and lay down. The dorm was dark, a low chorus of breathing. The gas smell was faint but present, as if it had followed me upstairs and curled at the foot of my bed.

I thought about my mother, about the way she would say my name if I didn't answer her calls. I thought about my followers and the way they called me *queen* in the comments. I thought about the tiles, about the light, about the shot that would make everything click into place.

I reached for my phone and opened the camera, just to see the ring light reflection on the screen. I typed a caption in the notes app: *Slow mornings, fast life. Lisbon, you have my heart.* I added a cigarette emoji. I deleted it. I typed it again.

When the alarm went off, I was already awake.

---

The hallway was colder before sunrise. The hostel felt asleep, a body in a slow, shallow breath. I moved quietly, lighter in pocket, cigarette tucked behind my ear, ring light under my arm. The tiles on the stairs were cool against my feet. The air smelled sweet in a way that made my jaw clench.

The kitchen door was closed. The sign was still there, curled at the corners, as if tired. I peeled it off and set it gently on the table, like I was borrowing it. I told myself I'd put it back. I told myself a lot of things.

I opened the courtyard door and the cold air rushed in. The light was thin but there. I turned on the ring light anyway. The tiles woke, the blue deepening, the white brightening. The room looked like a postcard of a place that hadn't failed yet.

I set the phone up on the mug, angled it toward me, and hit record. The red dot stared back. I sat, shoulders relaxed, lips parted, the expression I had practiced in mirrors for years.

The cigarette touched my mouth. The lighter was in my hand.

The hiss behind the stove was loud now, not a whisper but a steady, hungry sound. It felt closer, as if it were leaning in.

Ten seconds, I told myself. Ten seconds is nothing.

I closed the courtyard door halfway to warm the light. The smell thickened immediately. The tiles glowed. My head swam, just a little. I ignored it. I had a shot to get.

My thumb rolled the wheel.

The light had teeth.
