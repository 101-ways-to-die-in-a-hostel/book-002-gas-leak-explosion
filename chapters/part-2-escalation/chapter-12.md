# Chapter 12: The Back Burner

The room was already full of something I couldn't photograph.

I woke before the alarm, the smell slipping under the dorm door like a rumor. It sat on my tongue as soon as I opened my mouth, metallic and eggy, a taste that made water feel like it had been sitting in a copper pipe. My first thought wasn't *danger*. It was *this will be a problem for the shot*. The second thought, quieter and late, was *this will be a problem for me.* I buried the second thought under the first and got up.

Rafa texted at 6:31: *Kitchen now?* 

I sent a thumbs up and a spark emoji because I couldn't find any other punctuation for what we were about to do.

The hallway tiles were cold through my socks. The building whispered as I walked. The hiss behind the stove had a new insistence, like it had been practicing all night. I told myself I was tired. I told myself that's what hisses sound like in old buildings. I told myself we would be quick.

When I pushed open the kitchen door, the air felt thick enough to push back. The light was perfect—of course it was. Pale gold slanting through the small window's paint, catching the azulejos and making them glow like a museum exhibit. The dead plant in the corner had finally surrendered, its leaves brittle and curled. It looked like something to style, if death could be aesthetic.

Rafa was already there, ring light case leaning against the table, her ponytail still damp. She took one breath, wrinkled her nose, and then smiled like she hadn't. "This smell is criminal," she whispered.

"Criminally European," I said. It was the kind of line that would play well if this was a reel. In the quiet kitchen, it sounded like a confession.

We set up quickly. The tripod, the ring light, the phone propped on a ceramic bowl with a chipped rim. I placed the mug at the center of the table and turned it until the crack disappeared from view. The cigarette waited beside it like a prop from a sad film. The red lighter was in my palm, warm from my pocket, a heartbeat I could feel through my thumb.

The NO SMOKING sign had been replaced again overnight. Fresh paper, fresh warning. Someone had written, in sharp black pen, *Gas smell? Open door.* The handwriting was neat, like a teacher's. I let my eyes slide over it and pretended it was just another piece of kitchen decor.

"We do one unlit and one lit," Rafa said. "Then we're done. You'll have the take for the brand. It'll be perfect. Like... Sofia Coppola but poor." She laughed.

"Sofia Coppola but broke," I corrected, then took my spot at the table. The smile I practiced for the shot sat on my face like a mask warmed by my skin. I positioned my chin, turned my shoulder, looked at the tiles as if they were saying something worth listening to.

Rafa crouched behind the phone. "Three, two, one." The red light blinked.

I picked up the cigarette, unlit, let it hover near my lips. I lifted the lighter into frame, the metal top catching the ring light in a tiny flare. The smell was so thick now it felt like I was inhaling through cloth. My eyes watered. I blinked and smiled wider, because the camera doesn't care if your eyes are burning.

"Perfect," Rafa said. "Okay. Now lit. Just once. Quick. You know?" She said it like we were trying to steal a cookie.

I rolled the cigarette between my fingers. The paper felt dry, fragile. The lighter felt heavier than it should have. I could hear the hiss behind the stove, a whisper threading under everything. I told myself it was just background noise, like the fridge humming.

I flicked the lighter once, a reflex. The spark jumped and died, a tiny blue flash. Rafa sucked in a breath.

"Again," she said. "Slow. Let it catch."

My thumb hovered on the wheel. The room held its breath with me. The air was so still I could feel my own heartbeat echo against the tile.

"Sienna?"

Joana's voice came from the doorway. I froze, lighter still in my hand.

She stood there in her cardigan, hair pulled back, the morning light flattening her face into tired planes. Her eyes went to the lighter, then to my cigarette, then to the NO SMOKING sign as if it might intervene.

"Please," she said quietly. "Not in here. I told you."

"It's just one shot," I said. My voice came out small. I hated that. "I'm not even going to smoke it. It's for content." I hated that too.

Joana took a step in. The smell hit her and she grimaced. She didn't mention it. She never did. "Open the courtyard door. All the way." It was the closest she'd come to begging.

Rafa opened her mouth, ready to complain about the light, then closed it. She shrugged. "Fine. We can fix it in post." She swung the courtyard door open with her foot and the cold morning air rolled in, flattening the light and thinning the smell. The tiles lost their glow; the room became a kitchen again instead of a set.

Joana exhaled like she'd been holding her breath since last week. She stepped closer to the stove and pointed at the back burner. "Also—do not use that one. The back burner. It's broken." She said it quickly, like she hoped the sentence would be swallowed by the clatter of our equipment.

"Broken how?" Rafa asked.

Joana shook her head. "Just don't. Please." She glanced at the knob, then away. "Use the front. Or the kettle. Or... nothing." She heard herself say that last word and looked down, embarrassed.

"Okay," I said. I said it because that's what people say when they don't want to be difficult, and because I had no interest in turning this moment into a safety lecture. "Okay. We won't use it."

She nodded and left, pulling the door behind her. The courtyard air kept flowing. The light was now honest, unflattering. I felt my shoulders tense.

"We can still get it," Rafa said, forcing optimism. "We just have to pretend it's still dreamy." She shot me a look, and I adjusted my posture, rearranged my face. We shot the unlit take again. It looked less magical, more real, which in influencer language means less money.

"We still need smoke," Rafa said. She glanced toward the courtyard door. "Maybe outside?"

"The light is wrong outside," I said before I could stop myself. It sounded petty. It was petty.

"Okay." She sighed. "We'll figure it out."

My thumb rolled the lighter once more, not to spark, just to feel the ridges. The sound was tiny, satisfying. A little click that said control.

We wrapped in silence. The smell lingered, even with the door open. My head felt swimmy, like I'd stood up too fast. I blamed it on waking at 5:40. I always did.

"Tomorrow," Rafa said as she packed her ring light. "We do it tomorrow. Maybe earlier, before anyone wakes up and opens the door." She tried to make it a joke. It wasn't funny.

"Tomorrow," I echoed. I picked up the lighter and slid it back into my pocket like a secret. The word *tomorrow* has the shine of a promise. It also has the weight of a trap.

I lingered in the kitchen after she left, running my fingers along the cool tile. The azulejos were a pattern of flowers and loops, blue on white, a perfect repetition. I looked at the back burner and saw the knob, the line where the gas pipe disappeared behind it. I could almost see the leak, even though I couldn't. The hiss sounded louder now, as if the stove knew it had been noticed and was offended.

I took a picture of the warning note on the NO SMOKING sign. I framed it so the handwriting looked charming, a local's touch. I thought about captioning it *Safety, but make it cute.* I didn't post it.

By late morning, the hostel had filled with the usual chorus of keyboards and coffee spoons. The common room was a tangle of cords and limbs. I took a seat by the window, the one with the best light, and opened my laptop. The brand DM was still on the screen, blinking like a heartbeat.

*Need the smoke. Need the story. Need it by Friday.*

My bank app sat in the other tab, its red numbers like a bruise. I did the math in my head and then stopped because the math made me want to cry. I closed the bank tab. I opened Lightroom. I chose the version of my face that looked least tired.

Felix messaged: *Coffee?* 

I said yes and then immediately regretted it because I didn't have time. Time is the thing I never have, even though I'm always the one creating it. I met him anyway because he had that kind of energy that makes you believe you're more than your feed.

We walked down to a cafe on Rua da Prata, the one with the yellow chairs that everyone tags. It smelled like espresso and sugar and nothing dangerous. The barista nodded at Felix like they were old friends. He ordered for both of us. I pretended I didn't like my coffee sweet even though I always do.

"You look pale," he said, handing me the cup.

"It's the light," I said. It was the easiest excuse. I could blame everything on light.

He frowned. "The kitchen?"

I shrugged. "We shot this morning. Joana opened the door. It's fine." I said it quickly, a line I'd rehearsed.

He leaned in. "It's not fine. You smell like it." He sniffed the air around me and grimaced. "That's not coffee." He said it like an accusation.

I laughed. "It's the hostel. It's old. Everything smells like something." The line had become muscle memory. I didn't notice how often I said it until it was too late to stop.

"Old doesn't mean safe," he said, for the second time in as many days. He looked past me at a table where two girls were filming their pastel de nata on slow motion. "You're not even from here. You can leave."

"I can leave and lose the brand deal," I said before I could catch the words. The truth slipped out, unfiltered. It felt ugly in the open.

Felix's eyes softened. "That deal isn't worth your lungs." His voice was low. "Or your life."

I rolled my eyes, because that's what I do when I'm scared. "It's not going to kill me," I said. It felt like tempting fate. The universe didn't respond.

We drank our coffee. The cafe hummed with Spanish and Portuguese and the clink of cups. I watched a woman take a selfie with the marble counter and felt a sudden, vicious envy. She could take her photo and walk away. I had chosen a kitchen that smelled like eggs and now I had to pretend it was romantic.

On the walk back, Felix stopped at a hardware store and pointed at a shelf of smoke detectors. "You should buy one," he said, half-joking. I laughed. It was a horrible, defensive laugh, the kind that comes out when you're too tired to be kind.

"Imagine me hanging a smoke detector in a hostel kitchen," I said. "That would be content. *DIY safety queen.*"

He didn't smile. "You'd get more followers if you did that than if you light a cigarette," he said. He was wrong, but I didn't tell him.

When we reached the hostel, we paused in the courtyard. The lemon tree had lost a few leaves overnight. The air outside felt clean, crisp, almost sweet. It made the smell inside seem even worse by comparison. I took a deep breath like I was storing oxygen for later.

Maria was sweeping the stones, her broom making a soft shh-shh rhythm. She nodded at me, then glanced toward the kitchen door.

"Bad today," she said.

"It's always bad," I said lightly.

She frowned. "Today more. I called Pedro. He said tomorrow maybe." She spat the last word like it was a seed.

"Maybe what?" I asked.

She shrugged. "Gas man. Fix pipe. He never comes." She made the sign of the cross again, quick and automatic, and went back to sweeping.

The word *pipe* sat in my chest. I pushed it down with a caption in my head: *Lisbon is teaching me patience.* I hated myself for thinking that. I did it anyway.

The kitchen that afternoon was crowded with hunger. The smell of onions and garlic tried to claim the room, but the gas cut through it like a sour chord. Yuki was at the sink again, rinsing rice until the water ran clear. Lucas stood by the counter, rolling his shoulders as if the air hurt. Dylan chopped tomatoes with the reckless confidence of someone who'd never cut himself.

"Hey, content queen," Dylan said, nodding at me. "You coming to surf later?"

"I'm not a surf girl," I said, which was a lie. I was whatever I needed to be.

"You're missing out. The ocean doesn't smell like farts." He grinned.

"Neither do my filters," I said, and he laughed.

I went to the stove to boil water for instant noodles and stopped when I saw the tape. Yellow masking tape crossed the back burner in an X. Someone had stuck a sticky note above it: *DO NOT USE - GAS LEAK.* The words were in Portuguese and English, the English written in all caps like a shout.

For a second, my brain went quiet. The note made the thing solid. It had edges. It was no longer a vibe. It was a fact.

"They put that up this morning," Lucas said, catching my stare. "Joana told us. No back burner. Gas leak." He said it like he was talking about a flat tire, an inconvenience.

"Isn't that... like..." I struggled for a word that sounded less serious. "A big deal?"

"Old building," Dylan said, repeating my line back to me with a grin. He tapped the note. "This place is held together by tape anyway." He wiggled the yellow tape and it fluttered like a flag.

Yuki frowned. "We should leave?"

Lucas shrugged. "Where? Hotels are expensive. My room upstairs is fine." He said it like the gas had an elevator limit.

I laughed because the alternative was panic. "It's just one burner," I said. "We can use the front." I said *we* as if that made it safer.

"Front still smells like gas," Yuki whispered.

"It's the drains," I said, and realized too late that the line now sounded insane. Yuki looked at me like I was something she didn't know how to translate.

Dylan turned on the front burner anyway. The flame snapped to life with a soft whoof. The sound made me flinch. He didn't notice.

"I'm starving," he said. "Danger doesn't cook pasta."

The flame burned blue and steady. The hiss behind the stove threaded underneath it, still there, a steady breath. I felt my lungs tighten, not from fear but from something in the air. I took a shallow breath and told myself it was anxiety. Anxiety looks the same as a warning if you squint.

Joana appeared in the doorway, eyes going to the note on the back burner. She looked relieved it was still there, then her gaze caught mine. She held it a second too long. There was something in her face I couldn't name. Guilt? Anger? A kind of tired surrender? She opened the courtyard door and cold air spilled in, flattening the light and the smell, making the room feel less like a set and more like the backroom of a restaurant.

"Please keep this open," she said, not looking at anyone in particular. "All the time."

"It ruins the light," I said before I could stop myself. The words left my mouth and hung in the air, absurd and selfish.

Dylan snorted. "Light doesn't matter if you're dead," he said, and laughed like it was a joke. It was a joke. It was also true.

I forced a smile. "You're so dramatic," I said, and felt the sentence fall flat. Nobody laughed.

The door stayed open. The air shifted. The smell thinned but did not leave. The back burner sat taped and silent, like a mouth sewn shut. My noodles boiled in a front pot, the steam fogging my phone screen. I wiped it with my sleeve and found myself thinking about smoke, about the way smoke would curl in the light and make everything look cinematic. I also found myself thinking about gas, about the way it curled at the floor, invisible and patient.

Lucas filled his water bottle and left. Yuki carried her rice to the table. Dylan plated his pasta and tossed his knife into the sink. The room settled into the quiet of a meal, the smell of food mingling with the smell of risk.

My head ached. A slow, polite pressure behind my eyes. I told myself it was the ring light, the screen time, the early morning. I told myself I would nap later. I told myself anything that didn't involve leaving.

While I ate, I checked my phone. A comment under my latest story said, *Girl, is your hostel okay?* I stared at it, thumb hovering. I typed, *Yeah just old building vibes* and hit send. The lie was so easy it felt like breathing.

An email from the brand came in. *Need smoke for authenticity. Can you do a quick morning shot with cigarette?* The word *authenticity* made me laugh out loud. The sound echoed in the kitchen. Yuki looked up, startled. I smiled and said, "Sorry, just a funny email." I didn't explain.

I took a photo of the yellow tape and the warning note, framed like a cheeky behind-the-scenes. I didn't post it. I saved it. It felt too real for the grid.

---

After lunch, I tried to nap in the dorm, but the air had a flavor even upstairs now, a faint eggy sweetness that made my stomach turn. The new girl in the bunk below was watching a comedy with earbuds in, her shoulders shaking with silent laughter. I pulled the blanket over my head and tried to make myself a cave. The smell slipped in anyway, thin and persistent.

I opened my phone and scrolled. A creator I follow had posted a reel about hostel safety, all dramatic music and captions about trusting your instincts. I watched it twice, then closed it and opened my own drafts. My kitchen clips looked gorgeous, but now the haze near the floor caught my eye. I zoomed in and felt a small, nauseous flicker. I turned the brightness down until I couldn't see it. That felt like a solution, which is the same thing as denial with a filter.

My head was still aching. I wandered to the shared bathroom, hoping a shower would reset me. The tiles there were white and cracked, the grout gray with age. The hot water hissed as it came through the pipes, a different hiss than the kitchen but close enough to make my shoulders tense. Steam filled the small room, beading on the mirror, turning my reflection into a blur. The smell of gas wasn't here, but it felt like it might be hiding in the pipes, waiting for me to name it.

I stood under the water and let it run over my scalp, the shampoo foam rinsing down the drain. For a minute I felt clean, real, unfiltered. Then my phone buzzed on the counter and I was back inside my head, back in captions and comments. The bathmat was damp when I stepped out. The air was cold. I wrapped myself in my towel and made a mental list of shots I could do without smoke. The list was short.

The evening came with a wind that smelled like river and old stone. The rooftop hummed with voices, the string lights casting a warm, flattering glow that made everyone look a little drunk, even if they weren't. Rafa found me near the edge, cigarette behind her ear, hair pinned up like she was ready for a shoot.

"We need smoke," she said without preamble. "The brand is asking. They want the European cafe vibe. You can do a puff without inhaling, it's fine." She spoke like a manager.

"The back burner has a gas leak," I said.

"Yeah, but that's the back burner," she said. "We're not turning it on. We're just lighting a cigarette. It's not the same." She said it like logic, not denial.

I watched the lights of Lisbon flicker below us. Somewhere a tram bell rang. The air was cool, clean. It made the idea of the kitchen smell feel far away. If I stayed on the rooftop long enough, I could pretend the building wasn't breathing gas beneath my feet.

"Joana put up a sign," I said.

"Joana puts up signs for everything," Rafa said. "She put up a sign about washing dishes, too. Doesn't mean the plates are dangerous." She smiled to soften it. "We just need ten seconds of smoke. Ten seconds for a paid post. That's all." She said *paid* like it was holy.

I nodded because that was what I did when I couldn't decide. I nodded and let the promise settle into me like a pill.

Someone put on music. Someone handed me a plastic cup of ginjinha. I took it even though I didn't want it because it was easier than explaining why I didn't. The cherry liqueur burned sweet down my throat. The lights blurred. The city below looked like a map of answers I'd never find.

Felix appeared at the rooftop door, camera slung low. He caught my eye and shook his head, a small motion. It felt like a warning. It felt like judgment. I looked away.

Later, when the rooftop thinned and the air got colder, I went downstairs alone. The hallway smelled faintly of gas even here, the scent creeping through the old wood like a stain. I paused outside the kitchen door. The tape on the back burner was visible through the glass, pale and accusing.

I opened the door anyway.

The room was dark, the tiles swallowing the little light that came from the hall. The courtyard door was closed. The air was thick again, sour and sweet. The hiss behind the stove was louder at night, when nothing else competed. It sounded like a secret being shared with the room.

I set my phone on the table and turned on the ring light to see. The circle of light made the tiles look like an altar. The note on the back burner glared in the bright halo. I moved closer, read the words again. *DO NOT USE - GAS LEAK.* Someone had added a second line in smaller handwriting: *Peligoso.* Dangerous.

I touched the note with the tip of my finger. The paper felt damp. The tape was warm from the stove's residual heat. I should have left. I stayed.

I took the cigarette out, held it in the light, imagined the smoke curling. My thumb rolled the lighter wheel, not sparking it, just feeling the ridges. The click was soft, familiar. The hiss behind the stove answered it.

My phone buzzed. A DM from the brand: *Need final by Friday. Don't let us down.* The words felt like a hand on my shoulder.

I turned the lighter in my palm and thought about the money, about the rent, about my mother and her heart emoji, about the comment that said I looked tired, about the way my feed would look with that smoke shot, about how good it would feel to post something that got saved instead of just liked. I thought about all of it. I did not think about the gas.

I set the cigarette back down. I told myself I would do it in the morning, when the light was perfect and the door could be open, when it would be quick, when it would be safe enough. I told myself that because it was easier than admitting I was scared.

As I turned to leave, I heard a soft click behind me. The stove knob settling. The hiss breathed on. I closed the door and walked upstairs, the smell following me like perfume.

In the dorm, I set the lighter on top of my phone again, like a charm. I set my alarms: 6:40 and 6:43. I stared at the ceiling and listened to the building settle, the pipes ticking, the hiss below. The air tasted faintly of eggs even here.

I told myself tomorrow would be quick. I told myself tomorrow would be worth it. I told myself the light would make it all make sense.

Somewhere below, the back burner sat taped shut, the note flapping slightly in the draft, like a warning trying to wave its own arms.
