# Chapter 15: The Ten Seconds

Ten seconds feels like nothing until you have to spend it in a room that wants to burn.

I woke up before the alarm again, as if my body had learned the schedule of panic. The dorm was a dark aquarium of limbs and breath, the other girls floating under their blankets. I lay still and listened for the sound that had become a metronome to my mornings: the thin hiss from below, a thread of sound stitched into the building. It was louder today, or maybe the rest of the hostel was quieter. Either way, it sounded closer.

My phone buzzed under the blanket. The brand rep again. *Need the lit version. We’re scheduling. Please confirm.* The word please felt like a hand on my shoulder, insistent, polite, impossible to ignore. I thumbed back, *Yes!!* and put my face down into the pillow for a second, breathing fabric instead of air.

The lighter was warm on the nightstand, as if it had been waiting. The cigarette lay beside it, white and small and unremarkable, a prop and a threat. I tucked both into my hoodie pocket and swung my legs down. The floor was cold, the kind of cold that makes you move faster.

In the hallway, the smell greeted me like someone who knew my name. It had a sweetness now, syrupy and sharp, like rotten pears. I tasted it on the back of my tongue and told myself it was the cleaning products, the old wood, anything that wasn't the word Joana kept trying not to say.

The kitchen door was already open, a crack of light and a slice of air. I pushed it wider and stepped into the tiles. The room was blue, empty, and heavy. The courtyard door was closed, the chair no longer jammed against it. The air sat low, thick, as if it had pooled overnight and hadn't been disturbed.

Joana was not there. Maria was not there. It was just me and the hiss.

I set the ring light on the table and turned it on. The tiles flared to life, the azulejos waking in the halo like I had pressed a magic button. The warning tape on the back burner glowed a sickly yellow. The printed sign said *FORA DE SERVIÇO - GÁS* and the letters looked damp, as if the air had breathed on them.

I took the cigarette out and placed it on the saucer next to the espresso cup. I wanted the morning to look slow, indulgent, effortless. I wanted smoke in the light. I wanted it to feel like Lisbon and not like a leak.

The hiss behind the stove had a rhythm, a steady exhale. I could almost sync my breathing to it. I pulled the lighter out and rolled the wheel with my thumb, just a dry click, just the sound. The click seemed to echo. The hiss did not stop.

Ten seconds, I told myself. Ten seconds is nothing.

My phone vibrated. Rafa: *Morning?* The spark emoji beside her text pulsed like a dare.

*Soon,* I typed. My fingers shook a little. I blamed the cold.

I moved the chair out of the way and opened the courtyard door. The air thinned, the smell dulled, the light went flat. The tradeoff was immediate, like a switch. The tiles lost their glow and became just tiles again. The shot in my head dimmed.

I hated the light. I hated the door. I hated that the one thing I needed was always blocked by some stupid, reasonable safety precaution.

I closed the door halfway, just to see. The light warmed. The smell thickened. The hiss sharpened. I stood there with the door in my hand, negotiating with an invisible thing.

A cough from the hallway startled me. I jerked the door open and a cold gust slipped across my ankles.

Rafa appeared in the doorway, hair in a messy bun, holding her ring light case like a shield. She took one step inside and stopped. Her eyes watered. She blinked hard and smiled anyway. "It's bad," she said.

"It always is," I said.

She set her bag down and looked around. "Where's Joana?"

"Not here yet." I kept my voice light. I kept it breezy. I kept it wrong.

"We can do it quick," Rafa said. "Door open. We can fake the smoke. I have an overlay. We'll make it look real. The brand won't know." She was trying to save me. I could hear it in her voice.

I shook my head. "They'll know. You know how they are." The internet is a bloodhound for inconsistency. I had learned that the hard way.

Rafa sighed. "Okay. Ten seconds, then. But door open." She said it like a compromise, like a deal with a demon.

We set up in the thin light, the camera propped on the mug, the ring light supplementing the sun. The air was better with the door open, but not good. It clung to the floor. My head was already beginning to throb.

"Unlit first," Rafa said. "Then decide."

I nodded and lifted the cigarette, held it between my fingers like I knew what I was doing. The camera loved it. The light flattened the scene, but my face looked soft, the tiles still lovely, the moment still almost dreamy.

"Perfect," Rafa whispered. "Okay, now the lighter. Just the click."

I lifted the lighter, thumb on the wheel. I clicked it once, no spark. The sound cut through the room. The hiss answered it, a sharper, closer sound. I froze with the lighter midair.

"Did you hear that?" Rafa asked.

"The pipes," I said.

"It wasn't the pipes." She looked toward the stove. The warning tape trembled again, like a small flag in a weak wind.

The door from the hallway opened and Joana stepped in. She froze when she saw the lighter in my hand.

"No," she said, and the word landed like a slap. "Not today. Please."

"We're not lighting," Rafa said quickly. "We were just—"

"I said no." Joana's voice was harder than I'd ever heard it. She walked in, past us, straight to the stove. She crouched and listened, head tilted. The hiss was louder there. I could see the tiny movement of her hair as she leaned in. "This is worse," she said, to herself more than to us.

She stood up and met my eyes. "If you light anything in here, you could kill people," she said. It wasn't dramatic. It was flat, exhausted, the kind of truth someone says after repeating themselves too many times.

I felt heat rise in my face. "I'm not going to kill anyone," I said. The words were defensive, childish. The air didn't care.

Joana's jaw tightened. "I'm closing the kitchen for an hour," she said. "Everyone out. Now." She turned to Rafa. "Please."

Rafa nodded and began packing the ring light without a word. The metal legs clinked together, the sound too loud in the room. I set the lighter down and felt like I was putting down a weapon.

As we left, a door in the hallway opened and Lucas stepped out with his water bottle. He sniffed, grimaced, and took a step back. "It's worse," he said.

"Kitchen's closed," Joana said.

Lucas looked at the taped burner. "Because of the leak?"

Joana hesitated and then nodded. "Because of the leak."

"So what do we do?" Lucas asked.

"Go to a cafe," Joana said. She sounded like she wanted to laugh and couldn't. "Lisbon has many."

Lucas shrugged. "I'm broke," he said. "We all are."

Joana looked at him like she had no answer. She didn't. I didn't. We went upstairs, the smell following us like a stain.

In the dorm, I sat on my bunk and stared at my phone, the unlit footage looping. It was good, but not good enough. It had the promise of smoke without the payoff. It was like a tease, and the algorithm punishes a tease.

My head swam. I took an aspirin and washed it down with stale water. I told myself I was tired. I told myself the air would clear if I stayed in bed. It didn't.

My phone buzzed again. A new DM from @HostelReaper: *Ten seconds, huh?* The message was a needle. I stared at it and felt my skin prickle. I told myself it was a troll. I told myself it was coincidence. I told myself a lot of things.

I didn't reply.

---

The kitchen stayed closed for an hour. It felt like a rebellion, a small, ineffective one. At nine, Joana taped another sign to the door: *Kitchen closed for safety. Please use cafes.* The word safety looked fragile on the paper.

People grumbled. Someone peeled the sign off and put it back up upside down. Someone else posted a story of it with a laughing emoji. I watched the light on the tiles fade without me and felt a physical ache, like missing an appointment.

I left the hostel to breathe and wandered to a cafe two streets away. It had tiles too, but not *the* tiles. It had light too, but not *my* light. The coffee was expensive and the chairs were hard. I sat anyway, sipping slowly, watching the street, pretending I wasn't counting the minutes until I could go back and finish what I hadn't done.

Felix found me there, as if he had been following the smell. He sat down with his camera and a roll of film, his eyes sharp.

"You look ill," he said.

"I'm fine," I said. I said it before he finished the sentence.

He raised his eyebrows. "Joana told me she closed the kitchen."

"For an hour." I rolled my eyes. "She can't close it forever." It sounded cruel. I didn't mean it to. I just meant I had a schedule.

He leaned forward. "Why are you so determined to do this there?" His voice was soft, but there was a new edge to it.

"Because that's the shot." I said it like it was obvious. "Because people expect it. Because if I do it in a random cafe, it's just another coffee picture. The tiles are the point. The location tag is the point. It's what makes it a moment." The words poured out fast, practiced. I had said them in my head a hundred times.

He watched me, quiet. "And if you die for a moment?"

I laughed. I hated the sound. "I'm not going to die. It's ten seconds." I said it again, as if repeating it made it more true.

Felix shook his head. "Ten seconds is a long time when you're on fire," he said. It was a terrible joke. It landed anyway.

I stared at my coffee. The foam had collapsed into a brown pool. I felt a sudden, nasty prick of fear. I pushed it down with the heel of my hand and said, "It's going to be fine."

He didn't argue. He just looked tired. "You're not listening to anyone," he said. "Not Joana, not Maria, not me. You listen to your phone." He gestured at it on the table, screen down, the source of all my instructions.

"It's my job," I said.

"It's a job that would replace you in a day if you disappeared," he said quietly.

I flinched because it was true. The algorithm doesn't mourn. It just scrolls. I lifted the cup and took a sip to cover the sting. It was cold now, bitter and useless.

"Don't go back in there," he said. "Not today."

I nodded, because nodding is easier than agreeing. I changed the subject. He let me. We spoke about trivial things—light, weather, the way Lisbon looks like it was built to be photographed—and then he left to shoot something he called real.

When he was gone, I checked my phone. A message from the brand: *We need the smoke. If you can't deliver, let us know.* The threat was wrapped in polite words, the same way a warning sign is wrapped in a friendly font.

I left the cafe and went back to the hostel.

---

The common room smelled like warm laptops and damp towels, the kind of stale comfort a hostel always has by afternoon. The couch was full of people editing their lives into something clean. A guy with an engagement ring on a string around his neck was recording a TikTok about \"minimalism\" while sitting on a pile of laundry. I sat at the table by the window because the light still mattered, even when I wasn't shooting.

I opened Instagram and scrolled the comments on yesterday's story. The heart emojis had turned into warnings, a few people asking if the egg smell was safe, one person saying their cousin almost died in a kitchen leak in Prague. I liked the hearts and skipped the warnings. It felt like choosing between two versions of myself: the one who wants to be adored and the one who wants to be alive. I chose the easier one.

My mother had sent another message. *You sound tired. Are you eating?* It was the kind of question that makes you feel seen and scolded at the same time. I typed *Yes, Lisbon is feeding me* and attached a photo of a pastel de nata from the cafe, the custard glossy and rich. I didn't mention that I had eaten half of it because my stomach felt too tight for sugar. I didn't mention the headache that pulsed when I stood up too fast.

Across the room, Joana was on the phone again. Her Portuguese came in bursts, sharp and quick. She had the look of someone arguing with someone who couldn't hear her. She caught my eye and looked away, jaw clenched. When she hung up, she slammed the phone down and took a deep breath as if she'd been underwater.

\"He says tomorrow,\" she said to no one, but the room was quiet enough to hear. \"He says always tomorrow.\" She looked at me then, a small, tired flicker. \"If you want to smoke, go outside.\" The word smoke hung between us like a rope.

\"I'm not smoking,\" I said, and then realized how much effort it took to sound convincing.

Joana nodded anyway, as if she wanted to believe me. \"Gas is heavier than air,\" she added, surprising me with the fact. \"It sinks. It hides. It doesn't care about doors.\" She rubbed her forehead. \"Open the windows if you can.\" She said it like a prayer, not a plan.

I watched her walk back toward reception, shoulders tense. I watched the open doorway to the kitchen, the blue tiles visible like a postcard from a place that wanted me to be there. I wanted to be there. I wanted to not be there. My stomach twisted.

I went upstairs for my charger and passed Maria on the stairs, her arms full of clean sheets that smelled like lemon. She paused on the landing and looked at me, her eyes dark and direct. \"You look pale,\" she said.

\"Just tired,\" I said.

She clicked her tongue. \"Gas makes you tired. Gas makes you stupid.\" She said it like a proverb. \"Go outside. Drink water. Pray.\" She adjusted the sheets and continued up, leaving the sentence behind like a warning sign.

In the dorm, I splashed water on my face and stared at my reflection in the mirror. My eyes looked too wide, the whites a little too bright. I smiled anyway. I always did. I put on lip gloss and told myself that if I looked well, I would be well.

I went back downstairs and hovered near the kitchen door, the line between safe and not. The smell was a wall now, not a hint. I stood there and breathed it in, testing it the way you test a bruise with your fingertip. The hiss behind the stove was steady, a small snake in the walls. I told myself the kitchen would be safer later, when the gas company came, when Pedro finally decided to care. I told myself the light would be worse later. The two truths sat in my chest, fighting.

I chose the light.

---

The kitchen was open again by noon. The sign had been removed. The air was worse. It sat low and thick, the smell concentrated, as if the hour of closure had only trapped it more tightly. The hiss behind the stove sounded like a held breath.

Yuki was in the corner, microwaving rice. She glanced at me with a tired, apologetic smile. "Still smell," she said.

"Always smell," I said.

Lucas leaned against the counter with a protein bar, chewing slowly. "They closed it for an hour," he said. "That's like putting a plaster on a gunshot." He grinned, dark humor in his eyes.

Maria shuffled in with her broom and crossed herself before stepping fully into the room. "No, no," she muttered. "This is not good."

"They'll fix it," I said, to no one in particular. It was a reflex now, like breathing.

Maria stared at me, then looked away. "They will fix it after something happens," she said. "That's how people learn." She swept harder, the bristles scraping the tiles with a sound like a whisper.

Joana came in carrying a clipboard. Her face was flushed, eyes bright with a kind of anger I hadn't seen before. "Pedro says I am overreacting," she said, not to anyone, just into the air. "He says the gas company will come tomorrow. He says it is not serious."

"Tomorrow," Lucas said, flat. He took another bite of his protein bar. "Great."

Joana looked at all of us. "If you smell it, open the door," she said. "If you feel dizzy, go outside. If you want to smoke, do it in the courtyard." She said it like a list of prayers.

I felt the lighter in my pocket like a weight. I nodded. I said, "Okay," because that was what I always said.

The door to the courtyard was propped open again with the chair. The light was dull. My heart sank. I wanted the perfect light more than I wanted the clean air, and that should have scared me. It didn't. It just made me annoyed.

I poured water into a glass and watched the surface tremble. The smell stung my eyes. I blinked and the room swayed a little. My head pounded, the dull ache of a body trying to tell me something. I ignored it because that's what I do.

Lucas turned on the front burner for his oatmeal. The ignition clicked three times before the flame caught with a soft whoof. For a second, a brief tongue of orange flame flickered along the burner ring, higher than it should have been. Lucas flinched and then laughed it off.

"Old stove," he said.

The flame settled to blue. The hiss continued. Nobody moved.

Yuki looked at me. "You okay?" she asked.

"Yeah," I said, and smiled. My smile was for her, for the camera in my head, for the invisible audience that needed me to look fine.

I walked out into the courtyard and sat under the lemon tree, gulping clean air. The leaves shook in the breeze and tiny lemons dropped like green marbles. I picked one up and rolled it between my fingers, its skin rough, its smell bright. It felt like a lifeline.

My phone buzzed. Rafa: *We need to decide. Brand wants it today.*

I stared at the message, then at the kitchen door. Ten seconds. Ten seconds was nothing. Ten seconds was everything.

*Tonight,* I typed. *After everyone sleeps. I'll do it fast.* I told myself the door would be open. I told myself the air would be better. I told myself lies that tasted like metal.

---

The afternoon stretched long and sticky. The hostel was louder, heat and bodies and the sound of people trying to make a story out of a cheap bed. I stayed in the common room, editing, pretending I wasn't counting the hours until night.

Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the shot. The tiles, the light, the curl of smoke. It was the only thing that made sense. It was the only thing that felt like control.

At six, I went to the rooftop with a plastic cup of ginjinha and watched the sun slide down. The air up there was clean, the city a beautiful mess of orange roofs and blue shadows. Rafa sat beside me, cigarette in hand, smoke threading up like silk. I watched it and felt a physical hunger.

"You sure?" she asked, exhaling.

"I have to," I said. It sounded dramatic. It was just true.

She frowned. "I don't love this." She tapped ash over the railing. "But I'm not your mom." She smiled, and it was a little sad.

"My mom wouldn't get it either," I said.

"Maybe she would," Rafa said, and then we both looked away.

Felix appeared on the rooftop later, his camera hanging at his side. He saw me and shook his head once, a small motion that felt like a verdict. I felt the stab of it and ignored it. Ignoring things is my superpower.

The city lights came on, one by one, like a grid of tiny pixels. The hostel below them hummed with life and danger. I drained my cup and went downstairs.

---

It was after midnight when the hostel finally quieted. The hallways were a hush of closing doors and soft snores. I waited until the last of the rooftop laughter faded, then slipped out of the dorm with my phone, my lighter, my cigarette, and a heart that was beating too fast for the hour.

The kitchen door was closed. The sign about safety was gone. The air in the hallway already smelled sweet. I hesitated, my hand on the handle. The wood was cold. The hiss behind it was a steady whisper.

Ten seconds, I told myself.

I opened the door.

The room was dark and thick. The smell hit me like a wave, sweet and sour, pressing at the back of my throat. I kept my mouth closed and moved fast, as if speed could thin air. I set the phone on the table, switched on the ring light. The tiles flared to life, blue and white and perfect. The warning tape on the back burner glowed. The sign in Portuguese looked like a curse.

I opened the courtyard door as wide as it would go. The air rushed in, cooler, but the smell didn't leave. It clung to the floor and my legs like a wet dress.

I propped the phone on the mug, angled it just right. I set the cigarette on the saucer, placed the lighter beside it. I took a breath and felt it sting.

"Ten seconds," I whispered.

My phone buzzed on the table. A new DM lit the screen. *@HostelReaper: Count them.* The message sat there, bright and casual. I stared at it. My skin prickled.

"It's a troll," I said out loud, to the room. My voice sounded small against the tiles. The hiss answered, steady and patient.

I hit record.

I sat at the table and arranged my face into the expression that reads as effortless. I lifted the cigarette to my lips and held it there, unlit. The ring light warmed my skin. The tiles glowed behind me. It was beautiful. It was exactly the shot I had been chasing.

The lighter was in my hand. I could feel the ridges of the wheel against my thumb. My heart beat in my ears. The hiss behind the stove felt louder, but maybe that was just my pulse.

Ten seconds.

I closed my eyes for half a beat, the way you do before you dive. I opened them and looked into the camera like it could save me. My thumb rolled the wheel once. Just the click. No spark. I exhaled a laugh, nervous and quick.

"Again," I whispered. The lighter tilted in my hand, the metal catching the ring light. My thumb found the wheel, the familiar ridges, the tiny promise of flame.

The hiss seemed to lean toward me.

I counted in my head. One. Two. Three.

I was still on three when I heard a soft sound behind me, a click from the stove as if a knob had shifted, as if the building itself had moved in its sleep. I froze, lighter in hand, thumb ready.

Ten seconds is a long time when you don't know if you're breathing the right air.

I held my breath and counted to four.

Behind me, the hiss did not stop.

I pressed record longer, just a few more seconds, because I was already there and leaving would mean starting again. I told myself I would do it tomorrow if not tonight. I told myself I would do it now and be done.

My thumb rolled the wheel a second time.

The lighter clicked.

The room held its breath.

I did too.
