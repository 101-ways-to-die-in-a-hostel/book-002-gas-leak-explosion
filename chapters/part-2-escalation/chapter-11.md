# Chapter 11: The Air Has a Flavor

The alarm went off at 6:40 and the kitchen was already breathing up the stairs.

I sat up in the dark, hair stuck to my cheek, and tasted it—sulfur, damp, the sharp ghost of a boiled egg you can't find to throw away. The dorm was quiet in that pre-dawn way where everyone is breathing as if they don't want to be seen. My phone glowed like a small stage light, the only audience I had at this hour.

The shot in my head was waiting. It always did. I swung my feet down, pulled on leggings and the cream sweater that reads *soft morning* on camera, and reached for my ring light. The red lighter was on the nightstand, a blunt, plastic promise. I picked it up, then set it back down like I hadn't.

I checked my phone before my feet hit the floor because that is how I make sure the day exists. Notifications stacked like plates: a brand reply, two new followers, a DM from my mother I would ignore until it became guilt. My own face glowed back at me in the lock screen, filtered and calm. In the dark of the dorm, it felt like a different person. I toggled the front camera and found my real face, the eyes a little puffy, the mouth already rehearsing a smile. I told myself this was the price of the job. I told myself my parents had been wrong. I told myself anything that could keep me moving.

Someone snored softly from the bunk across the room. The new girl had one arm flung over her face like a corpse in a Victorian novel. The air up here was almost clean, just a trace of yesterday's kitchen that had followed me upstairs. I breathed in and out, testing it like a diver, and decided that if I moved fast enough, the day would feel normal.

The hallway was colder than my skin expected. The tiles on the stairs were beautiful even in the dark, patterns that felt like they knew something about repetition. The smell grew stronger the closer I got to the kitchen, not in a gradual way but like a hand moving toward your face. I held my sleeve to my nose, a gesture that could be read as a candid or a warning depending on who was watching.

When I pushed open the kitchen door, the room was empty and blue. The azulejos were pale in the dim, the table a black shadow, the small window still painted shut. The air was heavy enough that it felt like there was fog at ankle level, even though I knew there wasn't. I told myself, *old drains*, *old building*, *European plumbing*, like a mantra.

The rotten egg smell was so distinct it felt like a color. I could have named it if I had wanted to be honest. Instead I set up the ring light and framed the shot, moving the salt shaker an inch to the left, turning the chipped mug so the crack was hidden. I turned on the ring light and the tiles woke up, the pattern brightening like it was absorbing my attention.

Somewhere in the pipes, water ticked. The refrigerator hummed a dull, tired note. The gas stove looked asleep, knobs lined up like little teeth, but the hiss behind it kept its thin thread of sound. I found myself staring at the back wall for a second, at the stained plaster and the faint dark shadow near the connector, and then I looked away. Looking too long makes things real.

I set the coffee to boil even though I didn't plan to drink it. The kettle rattled, the metal popping as it warmed. The smell of instant coffee tried to fight the sulfur and lost. I leaned close to the tiles for a shot and caught a hint of lemon from the courtyard, the one note in the room that felt alive.

I heard the hiss behind the stove, the thin, steady sound that had become part of the kitchen's soundtrack. It was soft enough to ignore if you were busy, which is what I was. I slid my phone into place, hit record, and rehearsed a smile.

The NO SMOKING sign was still on the wall, still bold and red and ignore-able. I could almost see the comment thread that would appear under the shot—*girl that sign tho*—and the way I'd reply with a winking emoji and an *art is pain*. I could feel my future self typing it.

My phone buzzed with a new DM while I was setting up. I ignored it because I was busy, but my eyes flicked down anyway. *@HostelReaper: You see the sign yet?* The message sat there in its little bubble like a challenge. I told myself it was a troll and flipped my phone face down. The ring light washed the tiles in a soft halo, and I pretended that was enough protection.

Rafa appeared in the doorway with her hair in a bun and a coffee in her hand. She wore a hoodie that said *PARIS* in block letters and a look that said she was both tired and thrilled.

"Morning," she whispered, like we were doing something illegal. We were.

"Morning," I said. I gestured to the table. "Light's perfect. Like, the tiles are—"

"I know." She set her coffee down and sniffed. Her nose crinkled. "Smell's worse. It's like... egg farts. Do you think it's the drains?"

"Yeah," I said quickly. "Old plumbing. Lisbon is ancient. Everything smells like... history." I made it sound charming. I was good at that.

Rafa pulled a cigarette from behind her ear. "Let's be quick. We can do a take with it unlit and then one lit if we have time." She said it like a line item.

I nodded, heart doing that flutter that felt like ambition. We staged the shot: me at the table, coffee cup, cigarette between fingers, my head turned toward the tiles like I was listening to them. Rafa crouched behind my phone, whispering, "Chin up, tilt, hold."

I held the unlit cigarette and let the ring light flatter me. I could see myself in the screen—eyeliner perfect, lips slightly parted, the exact expression you want for *European slow morning*. The smell tugged at the back of my throat.

"Okay, now the lighter," Rafa said.

I picked up the red lighter. The plastic was warm from my pocket. I slid it into frame next to the cup. The spark wheel caught the ring light and glittered. My thumb touched it, more a touch of habit than intent.

"Not yet," I said, surprising myself. "Let's do a dry run first." It was an excuse. I didn't want the flame in this air, not because I believed in danger, but because the smell made the whole thing feel too real.

Rafa blew out a breath. "Fine. Dry run." She pressed record again. I lifted the lighter, flipped the top open, brought it toward the cigarette, and stopped just shy of the strike. I held the pause, the almost, the promise. The shot looked cinematic.

"That's gorgeous," she said, and I felt the small, bright wash of validation. It was like oxygen. I didn't notice that we were in a room that had too much of something else.

The door creaked and Joana appeared, wrapped in a cardigan, a loose braid down her back. Her eyes went straight to the cigarette in my hand.

"No smoking in here," she said gently. "Please." She didn't look at the stove. She didn't look at the air. She looked at me, like I was a problem she hadn't chosen.

"It's not lit," I said, and immediately felt like a child.

"Even so." She glanced toward the painted window and then to the courtyard door. "At least open this. The air..." Her sentence trailed off, the end swallowed.

Rafa rolled her eyes. "The door kills the light, though." She said it with a smile like it was a harmless complaint, like light was a medically relevant thing.

Joana hesitated, then reached for the handle and opened the courtyard door anyway. A cold breath slid across the tiles and the light flattened. The room felt less like a set and more like a kitchen. The smell thinned but didn't go away. It clung to the floor like a rumor.

I watched the light change on the tiles and felt something small and mean in my chest. It wasn't anger; it was loss. It was the feeling that the thing I wanted most had just been taken by a very reasonable request.

"We'll be quick," I said, as if that would solve both problems.

Joana nodded and left. Her steps faded down the hallway. The door to the courtyard stayed open, the lemon tree's leaves trembling in the draft.

We shot for another ten minutes. My head started to buzz with that low, swimmy feeling, like I'd stood up too fast. I blamed it on waking early. I blamed it on not eating. I blamed it on everything but the air.

"You okay?" Rafa asked.

"Just tired," I said. I smiled because I wanted the footage to look effortless, even if I wasn't. The ring light hummed like a tiny sun. The hiss behind the stove kept its rhythm, a metronome I didn't want to hear.

When we wrapped, Rafa slipped her cigarette back behind her ear and said, "Tomorrow we do the lit one. Okay? The shot is so close. We just need a little smoke."

"Yeah," I said. "Tomorrow." I said it like a vow, like a schedule, like a lie.

She left with her ring light and her coffee and that restless energy influencers carry like caffeine. I stayed a minute longer, alone in the kitchen. The door was still open. The tiles had lost their glow. The smell settled back in as if offended by the interruption.

I looked at the NO SMOKING sign and took a photo of it because irony is easy content. I wrote a caption in my head: *Rules exist so we can choose when to break them.* I told myself I was clever. I told myself I was safe.

I rinsed my cup, washed my hands, and left the kitchen with the taste of rotten eggs in my mouth. I told myself it was the coffee.

By mid-morning, the hostel had filled with the usual chorus: zippers, toilet flushes, a British guy complaining that the Wi-Fi didn't work like it was the Wi-Fi's fault he was on a budget. I sat in the common room with my laptop open and the scent of the kitchen stuck to my sweater like a stubborn perfume.

I edited the footage from the morning, cropping out the courtyard door, smoothing the light until it looked like a dream. I added a filter that warmed the tiles. I erased the shadows under my eyes. I considered how much of my life was spent erasing.

The video played on a loop. Me, lighter, cigarette, light. The moment before the moment. It looked intimate, soft. It looked like a life that smelled like vanilla candles and not gas.

I zoomed in and noticed a faint haze in the background, a soft blur near the floor that could have been early morning mist or a smudge on the lens. I adjusted the contrast to hide it. I justified it as art. I justified it as professionalism. If you show the wrong things, brands don't pay you to keep going.

When I posted the story, I watched the view count climb the way I used to watch weather apps, looking for signs. Each little number tick felt like a breath. I tried to imagine myself from the outside, a girl with a ring light and a lighter and a kitchen full of blue tiles. It looked aspirational. It looked like a warning disguised as a dream.

I posted a story anyway: a still from the footage with the words *morning ritual* and a tiny egg emoji because I thought it was funny. The comments came quickly—hearts, fire emojis, *obsessed*—and I let them wash over me. Validation is a drug with very good packaging.

I went to the courtyard to breathe real air. The lemon tree smelled bright and clean, almost citrusy, like it was trying to repair the damage. The ground was damp, the moss between the stones dark. I turned my face toward the sky and felt a thin, cool sun on my cheeks.

Maria was there, rolling a cart of linens from the storage room. She nodded at me, eyes dark and direct.

"You go in the kitchen early," she said. It wasn't a question.

"Just for a shoot," I said.

She made a sound that wasn't quite a laugh. "Shoot?" She waved a hand like she was brushing away a fly. "You young people and your photos." She leaned in and lowered her voice. "Smell bad today. Very bad. Be careful."

"It's the drains," I said automatically.

Maria's mouth pressed into a line. "Not drains," she said. "This smell is..." She searched for the word. "Eggs, yes. But not eggs. Gas. You know gas?" She mimed a flame with her fingers, then snapped her hand shut.

I laughed because that was easier than letting her sentence land. "It's fine," I said, the words tasting thin. "They would have fixed it if it was serious." I said *they* because it made the responsibility someone else's.

She looked past me, toward the open doorway, and for a second her face softened. "We pray for you," she said, as if prayer was the only maintenance plan left. Then she shook her head, the moment closing, and rolled her cart away.

She shook her head and wheeled her cart away, muttering in Portuguese. I caught *Nossa Senhora* and *explode*, but I told myself she was dramatic. Older people always are. That's what I tell myself when they say things I don't want to hear.

I went back inside and almost collided with Joana at the desk. She was pinning up a new flyer for a pub crawl, her fingers moving with the efficiency of someone who knows the script.

"Morning shoot go well?" she asked.

"Great," I said. "The light was perfect."

She hesitated, then lowered her voice. "Did you open the courtyard door?"

"Yeah," I said, because I did. Eventually. "Maria told me to." I tried to make it a joke. "She's scary."

Joana gave a small smile that didn't reach her eyes. "She's right." Then she straightened, smoothing the flyer. "If you feel dizzy, go outside. Okay?"

"I'm fine," I said. The sentence was a reflex. I could have been on fire and said it.

She looked like she wanted to say more and then thought better of it. She took a breath, looked past me toward the kitchen, and returned to her computer. Her shoulders were tense, like she was carrying something heavy that no one else could see.

I went upstairs to my dorm, sprayed perfume on my hair, and felt the smell of gas fight with vanilla. I chose vanilla because it matched my aesthetic. I chose vanilla because it was easier than a warning label.

By noon I was out on the street, because Lisbon always feels like a reset. The city was all gold and shadow, trams clattering past, tourists singing into their phones. I met Felix at the miradouro, his camera around his neck, a coffee in his hand. He handed it to me like a peace offering.

"You look like you haven't slept," he said, squinting into the sun.

"I woke up early," I said. "Needed to catch the light."

"You always need to catch the light," he said. "You should catch some food, too." He handed me a pastel de nata in a napkin. The custard was warm and sweet, the sugar sticking to my lips. I took a bite and felt my stomach relax like it had been holding a breath all morning.

We sat on the stone steps with the city spilling beneath us. I scrolled through my feed while he adjusted his lens. A girl I used to go to school with had posted a photo of her baby. My mother had liked it. I hovered over the heart and didn't tap it. Instead I typed a caption for a reel that didn't exist yet: *Lisbon makes you believe you can be different.* It was true, and it was a lie, and it sounded like something that would get saved.

"How's the hostel?" he asked.

"Cute," I said, and then added, "It smells like eggs." I said it like a joke.

He frowned. "Eggs?" He tilted his head. "Do you mean gas?"

"Old drains," I said, the line now welded into my mouth. "It's just... old." I moved my hand through the air like I could wave the issue away.

Felix didn't laugh. He looked at me for a long second. "Old doesn't mean safe," he said. "It means old." He took a sip of his coffee. "Be careful, yeah?"

"I'm careful," I said, and then smiled because I didn't want this conversation to become real. He raised his camera, taking a photo of me mid-bite. I posed without thinking, eyes bright, the perfect expression for someone who didn't smell gas in her hair.

We walked through a market, past stalls of oranges and sardines. A man was selling candles shaped like saints. I bought one because it was cute and because I wanted a prop for a future shot—maybe a slow-lit candle on the kitchen table, another morning ritual. The vendor wrapped it in brown paper and smiled like a priest blessing a confession.

On the walk back, I checked my phone and saw a comment under my morning story: *Is that cigarette inside??* I replied with a laughing emoji and typed, *it's just a prop, babe.* I meant it. I also didn't. It was both.

When I opened the hostel door, the smell hit me before I reached reception. It was worse than in the morning, heavier, the air thick with something you could almost see if you squinted. I took a shallow breath and kept walking. I didn't want to be dramatic. Dramatic people are ignored.

Evening at Casa dos Azulejos always arrived like a party starting in the next room. Voices rose, bottles clinked, music drifted down from the rooftop. The common room filled with backpackers and their soft desperation, everyone laughing like they were in a commercial.

I went to the kitchen to drop off my candle because I couldn't help myself. The tiles were lit by the last bits of sun, a honeyed glow that made everything look softer. The dead plant in the corner was still dead, crisp and brown, the pot coated in a fine grey dust. The NO SMOKING sign had been replaced again, the paper so fresh it curled at the edges. Someone was trying. Someone always tries.

Yuki was at the sink, rinsing rice again, her hands careful, her face tense. Lucas leaned against the counter, filling his bottle, eyes half-lidded like he was fighting sleep. Dylan was nowhere in sight.

"Dylan went surfing with some guy from reception," Lucas said when he saw me looking. "He said the air in here makes him feel hungover." Lucas said it like a joke, but his eyes slid toward the stove anyway.

"Hey," Yuki said. She smiled, small and polite. "Smell is very strong tonight." She wrinkled her nose.

"It's the drains," I said, because that's what I was now. A spokesperson for denial.

Lucas snorted. "Drains don't smell like eggs. This is gas." He said it matter-of-factly, not dramatic, not trying to scare anyone. It was just information.

I laughed, light and quick. "It's an old building. Everything smells like something." I dropped my candle on the table, then immediately regretted it because the white wax looked too stark against the wood. I moved it closer to the tiles, imagining a shot.

The smell was sharp enough now that it cut through whatever we were making. It had a metallic edge that made my tongue feel dry. I pressed my lips together and pretended I hadn't noticed. My brain, unhelpful as ever, started writing captions for a candle-lit breakfast in this exact room.

Yuki glanced at the painted window. "Can we open?"

"If we open, the light goes flat," I said before I could stop myself. The words sounded ridiculous in the air, even to me.

Lucas looked at me like he was trying to decide if I was joking. "Light's not worth headaches," he said. He reached for the courtyard door and swung it open. Cold air rushed in, scattering the smell and my sense of control.

"Thanks," Yuki said softly.

I smiled at them like it was fine. It was fine. I could adapt. I was always adapting. I took my phone out and framed the candle against the tiles with the door open. It was a different kind of light, less dramatic, more real. I told myself I could make it work.

Joana appeared in the doorway again, as if summoned by the sound of the door opening. She glanced at the stove, then at me, then at the candle.

"No open flames," she said gently, gesturing to the candle. "Not in here, please."

"It's not lit," I said, the line almost a reflex now.

"Even so." She rubbed her forehead. "Maybe on the rooftop?"

I nodded, because I didn't want to be difficult. The candle was a prop, not a hill to die on. I picked it up and left the kitchen, the air clinging to me like a damp sweater.

Upstairs in the dorm, I set the candle on my nightstand and opened my laptop. Rafa had sent a draft edit from the morning shoot. I watched it twice. The unlit cigarette looked like a promise, the lighter like a dare. The moment before the flame felt intimate, conspiratorial. It felt like the kind of shot that people would screen-record and save. It felt like power.

A message from a brand popped up: *Need the final morning routine by Thursday. Can you include a little smoke for the cafe vibe?* I stared at the screen and felt my pulse quicken. Smoke was the missing ingredient. Smoke was the thing that would make the shot feel real, cinematic, European. Smoke was the thing that could get me a paid campaign instead of another "exposure" offer.

I texted Rafa: *Tomorrow we do the lit one. 6:40. Promise.*

She replied with a fire emoji.

I set my alarm again, two of them, labeled *shoot* and *backup*. I put the lighter on top of my phone so I wouldn't forget it in the dark. I lay back and stared at the ceiling. The dorm smelled like perfume and damp clothes and, faintly, the sweet bite of gas threading up through the floorboards. The building settled with a sigh. Somewhere below, a knob clicked. The hiss continued, a thin whisper, the kind you only hear when everything else is quiet.

I opened my mother's message and typed, *All good. Hostel is cute. Kitchen smells like eggs lol.* I stared at the sentence until it felt like a dare and then hit send. The read receipt came a minute later. She sent a heart emoji back. I stared at that too, a small red thing beating on the screen.
I listened for the hiss and told myself it was just pipes talking to an old building.

I told myself it was normal. I told myself it was drains. I told myself the smell would fade by morning. I told myself the light would be perfect.

I fell asleep with my hand on the lighter like it was a talisman, and the air in the room tasted faintly of eggs.
