# Chapter 13: The Light Doesn't Care

The air had weight now, like it could bruise you if you walked into it too fast.

I woke to that weight pressing down on my chest before my alarm went off. It sat there like a hand, like someone who wanted attention. For a second I thought it was just anxiety. My phone was on the bunk beside me, the screen a blue glow. I reached for it and felt the red lighter under my fingers. The plastic was warm. I had slept with it on top of my phone like a talisman.

Outside, the city was still asleep. Inside, the hostel was already breathing in a way that wasn't mine. The smell in the dorm was faint, just a suggestion of eggs and metal, but it was there. It had moved upstairs in the night, confident now, like it had earned the climb. I held my breath, then exhaled slowly, as if that would negotiate with it.

I checked the time. 6:38. Two minutes before my alarm, two minutes before a day that already felt like a script I'd rehearsed. I slid out of bed and pulled on my leggings and the cream sweater, the uniform. My reflection in the dark window looked tired and a little too real. I turned the camera on and found the version of myself that looked like a morning was a choice, not an obligation.

My phone buzzed with a message from Rafa: *6:45?* The spark emoji sat beside it like a dare.

I typed *yep* because the other thing I felt was fear, and fear doesn't pay.

The hallway was colder than it should have been. The tiles were slick under my socks, the building settling around me like an old animal. The hiss from the kitchen was louder, a steady thread pulling me forward. I told myself it was just the refrigerator, just the pipes. I told myself the kitchen was a set and I was a professional and this was what professionals did.

The kitchen door was open already. Joana stood inside, her cardigan tied around her waist, hair still wet. She had the courtyard door open too, a rectangle of night air in the blue room. She was staring at the stove like it could talk back.

"Morning," she said, as if we were both normal people.

"Morning." I stepped inside and felt the air push against my legs. The cold from the courtyard cut through it, but the smell was still there, pooling low. The warning tape on the back burner looked like a tiny crime scene. Someone had added another note, the same neat hand: *Gas man today?* with a question mark that felt like a prayer.

Joana looked at my hands. The lighter was peeking from my sleeve. "No smoking," she said, but not like a rule. Like a plea she had already given too many times.

"I know," I said. "It's just a shoot. We won't light it." I heard myself and hated that the sentence had become muscle memory.

She pressed her lips together. "Keep the door open. Please." She said it like she was asking for a favor, not enforcing a rule. "And don't use the back burner. You saw the note, yes?" She rubbed the bridge of her nose, as if it hurt.

"We won't," I said. "It's fine. We'll be quick." I said it because *quick* is what you say to make people stop worrying.

"Quick doesn't change the air," she said under her breath, then she turned and left before I could answer.

Rafa came in a minute later, bundled in her jacket, ring light bag slung over her shoulder. She breathed in, made a face, then smiled like it didn't matter. "It's stronger," she said, like we were reviewing a candle.

"It's fine," I said.

"It's not fine," she said. "But it is content." She wiggled her eyebrows. Dark humor is easier than panic.

We set up in the cold light from the courtyard. The tiles looked flatter with the door open, the pattern less dreamy, more like a bathroom in a train station. I moved the mug to the table's edge, turned it until the crack hid. I set the cigarette beside it. The lighter clicked in my palm, that tiny sound of control. The hiss behind the stove clicked back.

"We can close the door for a minute," Rafa said. "Just for the take. Then open it again." She said it like a compromise between art and air.

I hesitated. The smell was already bad with the door open. Closing it would be like walking into a coat you already know has been worn too long. I thought of the brand email, the word *authenticity*, the red numbers in my bank app. I thought of my mother, of the way she says my name when she is worried. I thought of the tiles, of the light, of the way my grid would look with a curl of smoke in it.

"Just for a minute," I said.

Rafa shut the door. The room changed immediately, the air thickening, the light sliding into that perfect golden angle. It was cinematic in a way that made my stomach twist. The smell was sharp, almost sweet, the kind of sweetness that makes your teeth hurt. I breathed through my mouth and told myself it was the coffee.

"Okay," Rafa said. "Unlit first. Then we decide." She hit record.

I lifted the cigarette, smiled at the tiles like they were a lover, and held the pose. The ring light warmed my face. The kitchen hummed. The hiss behind the stove was a thin scream now, but it was steady. I was steady too. This was the job.

"Perfect," Rafa whispered. "Okay. Lit?" She said it softly, like she knew it was wrong and wanted me to say no.

I looked at the lighter. I looked at the NO SMOKING sign. I looked at the taped burner, the note in Portuguese. I thought of the comment asking if my hostel was okay. I thought of the email that said *Don't let us down.* I thought of what it would look like, a single flame, a tiny glow in the morning light.

"Not now," I said, and surprised myself with the relief in my voice. "We'll do it tomorrow. With the door open." I said it like a compromise, like a deal.

Rafa exhaled and gave me a small smile. "Fine. But tomorrow. Promise." She packed the ring light with quick, angry movements, the kind you make when you feel stupid for trusting someone else's timeline.

"Tomorrow," I said. I said it to her. I said it to myself. The word hung in the air like smoke that hadn't arrived yet.

We opened the courtyard door again and the room thinned. Cold air slid along the tiles, lifting the smell only a little. I set the lighter down on the table, fingers shaky, and pretended the shake was from caffeine.

"You're pale," Rafa said.

"It's the light," I said. I made it a joke. It wasn't.

She left with a muttered, "Don't be late," and I was alone with the hiss and the tiles and the bad air that felt like it had a personality now.

The door swung again and an older man I had seen once in the stairwell shuffled in, barefoot, wrapped in a towel like a robe. He had the soft belly and tired eyes of someone who had once been rich and was now on a budget. He sniffed, frowned, and said something under his breath in Portuguese. I didn't understand, but the word *gas* is the same in most languages. He crossed the room and pushed the courtyard door wider, then turned toward the painted window and tried to lift it. It didn't move. He slapped the frame, annoyed, then muttered something that sounded like a prayer and left without looking at me.

The air thinned with the door open, but the light went flat. The tiles lost their halo. I stared at them anyway, the way you stare at someone you love even when they're disappointing you. I rearranged the mug and shot a few stills because I couldn't admit I was done. I tilted the camera higher to avoid the floor, to avoid the invisible thing pooling there. The hiss from behind the stove kept its low, polite insistence. It wasn't loud enough to scare me. It was loud enough to be annoying, which is somehow worse.

I opened the courtyard door wider. The lemon tree outside trembled in the draft. I leaned in the doorway and took a deep breath. It tasted clean, like leaves and damp stone. I held it in my lungs and felt, for a moment, like I could store air the way I stored footage. Then I went back inside because the mug was still on the table and the shot was still waiting.

---

By late morning, the hostel had the damp buzz of a building full of people pretending the day was normal. The common room was a nest of laptops and cords, someone playing a podcast about productivity too loud. I sat by the window with my laptop open, editing the morning footage. The light looked perfect. The air didn't.

I ran the clip twice and saw it in the background, a faint wobble near the floor, a heat shimmer that wasn't heat. I knew it was probably just the way the ring light hit the tiles, just the compression of the phone camera, but my stomach tightened anyway. I adjusted contrast, lifted highlights, cropped tighter. I erased the floor from the frame. Problem solved, I told myself. I told myself that a lot.

Joana walked through the common room with a stack of clean towels. Her face was set, jaw tight. She stopped at the reception desk, opened a drawer, took out a phone, and dialed. She spoke in Portuguese, fast and low. I couldn't understand much, but I heard *gas* and *hoje* and her voice got sharper on the last word. She hung up with a small slam of the receiver.

She caught me watching and tried a smile. It didn't land. "Gas company," she said in English. "They say maybe after lunch." The word *maybe* was heavier than the towels.

"They'll fix it," I said.

Joana looked at me like she wanted to correct me and then thought better of it. "I hope," she said, and walked away.

I opened my bank app again, because I am addicted to both numbers and pain. The red was deeper than yesterday. The brand contract sat in my email like a threat. I closed the bank app and opened Instagram. The story from yesterday had reached thirty thousand views. I watched the numbers tick up and felt the sweet sting of validation. It was a real drug. It was also free, which made it dangerous.

I escaped to the street with my camera and no plan. Lisbon forgives you for having no plan. The morning was crisp, the light already gold, tram bells clanging like a soundtrack. I walked past a bakery and breathed in warm sugar. The smell made me realize how much the kitchen had been sitting in my nose, a permanent guest. I bought a pastel de nata and ate it standing on the sidewalk, flakes of pastry falling on my sweater. It tasted like clean air.

Felix found me on a bench in a small square, camera in his lap, coffee in his hand. He didn't ask if I wanted one; he just handed it to me. The cup was warm and solid, a small kindness.

"You smell like gas," he said, not unkindly.

"Thanks," I said.

He smiled anyway. "There's a cafe two streets over with tiles and a big window and no smell. You can shoot there. I'll even hold the reflector."

I pictured it and felt the pull. I also felt the way my chest tightened at the idea of letting go of Casa dos Azulejos. The tiles there were famous. The tag was known. The location had a pull with my followers. A different cafe wouldn't count in the same way. It was irrational, but so was everything I did. "It's not the same," I said.

"It's safer," he said.

I took a sip of coffee. It was too hot and it stung my tongue. "I just need one shot," I said. "Then I'll leave. It's like... the last thing."

He looked at me the way people look at someone who says *last thing* for the fourth time. "You said that yesterday," he said.

"Yesterday wasn't today," I said, and it sounded stupid even to me.

We sat in the square and watched a little girl chase pigeons. Her mother filmed it, laughing. The scene was perfect, real, uncurated. For a second I felt a pang that wasn't envy, exactly, but something like it. Then my phone buzzed with a notification and the feeling dissolved into the rush of being noticed.

Felix texted me: *Gas guy came?*

*Not yet,* I typed. Then, because I didn't want to look weak, I added: *It's fine.*

He replied with a single word: *Leave.*

I stared at it for too long. Leaving would mean going somewhere else, somewhere without the tiles, somewhere without the shot. Leaving would mean admitting my parents were right. I set the phone face down and told myself I could leave after the shoot, after the brand paid, after the proof that this wasn't all for nothing.

I was making coffee in the kitchen when the gas man didn't show up. Noon passed, then one, then two. The smell in the kitchen swelled in the afternoon heat. It mixed with garlic and old cooking oil and made my eyes water. Maria swept the floor with her jaw tight, the broom whispering over the tiles.

"He not coming," she said.

"Joana said after lunch," I said.

Maria shook her head. "After lunch, after tomorrow, after never." She tapped the broom handle against the floor, a sharp, wooden punctuation. "Pedro say later. Always later." She glanced at the stove and crossed herself. "We have mercy." She said it like a blessing and a warning.

Yuki came in with a bowl of rice and wrinkled her nose. "Still smell," she said.

"Always smell," Maria said. She sounded tired.

I wanted to be the person who said, *Maybe we should not be in here,* but I was also hungry and tired and pretending to be fine. I turned on the front burner for the kettle. The flame snapped up and I flinched. The hiss behind the stove threaded through the flame, a thin, constant exhale.

Lucas leaned on the counter, reading something on his phone. "Gas company isn't coming," he said without looking up. "I asked Joana. She said Pedro told them to wait until next week." He said it like an update about the weather.

"Next week?" I said. My voice was higher than I wanted it to be.

Lucas shrugged. "They're broke. So are we." He lifted his water bottle and took a long drink. The plastic crackled in his hand.

"Maybe we should report it," Yuki said quietly.

"To who?" Lucas asked. "We are guests. We complain, we get a refund, we leave. That's the system." He said it like he had practiced it.

The kettle whistled. The steam was warm, clean. I let it fog my face and pretended it was safe. I poured the water over instant noodles and watched the curls soften. Hunger is a loud problem. Danger is quiet until it's not.

I carried my bowl to the table and stared at the NO SMOKING sign. Someone had added a drawing of a skull next to the cigarette icon. It was a joke, or it was a warning. In this kitchen, those two things were the same.

My phone buzzed with a comment: *Girl, you really smoking inside?* I typed a reply, deleted it, typed again. *No, it's a prop.* I sent it and felt my face flush, as if the lie had heat.

Dylan walked in with a surfboard under his arm, sand still on his hair. He took a deep breath and waved his hand in front of his face. "It's worse," he said. "You guys still in here?"

"We're eating," Lucas said.

Dylan pointed at the open courtyard door. "Keep it open. Like, all the way." He looked at me. "You're still doing your cigarette thing?"

"Maybe," I said.

He raised his eyebrows. "You're brave," he said, and then he laughed like it was a compliment. He left the door wider, a rectangle of light and air that cut the room in half.

I finished my noodles without tasting them. My head throbbed, a low pressure behind my eyes. I told myself I needed water. I told myself I needed a nap. I told myself I needed to stop thinking so much.

By evening the hostel had a different kind of smell, the sweetness of cheap wine and sweat, the rooftop string lights humming like a promise. I climbed up with Rafa and a plastic cup of ginjinha. The city below was a map of gold and shadow. The air up here was cool and clean and it made everything below seem like a dream, or a mistake.

Rafa lit a cigarette and inhaled. The smoke curled around her face, soft and theatrical, exactly what the brand wanted. I watched it and felt my mouth water with the desire to capture it. I could almost see the shot: me at the kitchen table, the tiles glowing, smoke threading up like lace.

"We can do it tomorrow," Rafa said, exhaling. "Early. Before anyone opens the door. We'll be quick. Ten seconds." She said it like she was timing a sprint.

"Ten seconds," I said. I said it like it was a plan, like it was safe.

Felix came up the rooftop stairs, camera strap across his chest. He stopped when he saw me and his eyes went past my face, to the cigarette in Rafa's hand, to the lighter in my lap. He shook his head.

"Don't," he said. He didn't need to explain.

"It's a shoot," I said. I laughed, because laughter makes a shield.

"It's a leak," he said back. He wasn't smiling. "It's not a vibe." He said it like he was tired of my language.

I took a sip of ginjinha and let it burn. "It's fine," I said. The lie felt thin in the clean air.

Felix looked out over the rooftops. "You know gas doesn't care about your caption," he said. "It doesn't care if you are a brand deal or a broke girl. It just is." He looked at me then, and his voice softened. "Come with me to a different place. We can shoot somewhere else. There are a thousand tiled cafes in Lisbon that don't smell like eggs." He said it like a door.

I felt the door. I also felt the weight of the lighter in my pocket, the email from the brand, the red numbers. I felt the way my life had narrowed to one kitchen, one shot. I shook my head because shaking your head is easier than changing your life.

"I can't," I said, and I meant *I won't.*

Rafa flicked ash over the railing. "It'll be quick," she said, as if that solved it.

Felix gave me a look I couldn't place, something like pity and anger braided together. He walked away without another word. I watched him go and tried not to feel anything about it.

The rooftop noise rose around me, laughter and clinking cups, someone playing a song that sounded like summer. The city was beautiful. The hostel below was not. I told myself I could hold both truths at once.

I went down to reception for water and found Joana at the desk, phone pressed to her ear, her voice sharp in Portuguese. The words spilled out fast, and I caught fragments: *cheiro*, *fuga*, *agora*. Smell. Leak. Now. She glanced up and saw me, her face tightening, and she lowered her voice. A man's voice bled through the speaker, slow and dismissive. I didn't understand the words, but I understood the tone. It was the tone of someone who owned something and wasn't afraid to lose it.

She hung up and pressed her palm to her forehead. "Pedro says the gas company will come tomorrow," she said, like she was reciting a line.

"Tomorrow," I echoed. The word had become a chorus.

She gave me a tired half-smile. "He says it's not serious. He says we've had this smell before." She looked past me toward the kitchen door and her eyes hardened. "Smell is not normal," she said. Then she straightened, the moment closing, and said, "Drink water. If you feel dizzy, go outside." It was a warning disguised as hospitality.

Later, when the rooftop thinned and the air got colder, I went downstairs with the lighter in my pocket and the smell already faint in the hallway. It had learned to move. It was in the wood now, in the fabric of the curtains, in the towels. It felt like a rumor that had become fact.

I stopped outside the kitchen door. The NO SMOKING sign was visible through the glass, the skull drawing grinning in the ring light's reflection. I wanted to turn away. I opened the door anyway.

The kitchen was dark, the tiles swallowing the little light that slipped in from the hallway. The courtyard door was closed. The air was thick, almost warm, the smell heavy and close. The hiss behind the stove was louder at night, a steady, insistent whisper. It sounded like the building was letting out a secret it could no longer keep.

I turned on the ring light. The tiles flared to life, blue and white and perfect. The warning tape on the back burner glowed a sickly yellow. The note said *DO NOT USE - GAS LEAK* and underneath, in smaller handwriting, *Call Pedro.* The ink looked blurred, like it had been damp.

I pulled the cigarette from my bag, held it under the ring light, imagined the smoke curling in this exact glow. My thumb rolled the lighter wheel once, not sparking it, just feeling the ridges. The click was sharp in the quiet. The hiss behind the stove answered it.

My phone buzzed with a new email. *Need the morning ritual by Friday. Please confirm.* The word *please* made it worse. I stared at it until the screen dimmed.

I could have left. I could have closed the door, put the lighter away, gone upstairs and slept like a normal person. Instead I set the cigarette on the table and placed the lighter beside it, a still life of temptation. I framed the shot with my phone, checked the angle, checked the light. The tiles looked like a dream. The air tasted like pennies.

"Tomorrow," I whispered into the empty room. The word came out like a promise, like a dare.

I closed the ring light and the room fell back into dark. I opened the courtyard door a crack, as if a crack could negotiate with a leak. The lemon tree shivered in the draft. I stood in the doorway and breathed in real air until my lungs didn't ache.

Upstairs, I set my alarm for 6:40 and 6:43 again. I put the lighter on top of my phone, the cigarette beside it, the tools of tomorrow lined up like makeup brushes. I lay back and stared at the ceiling, listening to the building settle, the pipes ticking, the hiss below.

The air tasted faintly of eggs even up here. I told myself it was the towels. I told myself it was the building. I told myself the light would be worth it.

In the dark, my thumb found the lighter wheel and rolled it once, the tiny click of a future decision. Somewhere below, the hiss answered.
