# Chapter 19: The Valve That Turns Back

I woke up to the sound of a shower running, which meant somebody had turned the gas back on.

For a second I just lay there in the bunk and listened to water that was too steady, too warm-sounding for a hostel that had been punishing us with cold for days. The dorm smelled faintly of soap and damp hair instead of the sour chemical tang that had moved in like a roommate. Somebody laughed in the bathroom, a bright, relieved sound. The pipes groaned in the wall. My body decided, without asking me, that it wanted a hot shower more than it wanted to be safe.

Then the smell crept back in, thin as a thread, and the relief curdled. It wasn't the full punch from yesterday, but it was there, a whisper that said *remember*. I rolled over and checked my phone. 5:57 AM. The screen was smeared with a fingerprint across my own face from last night's doom-scroll.

A notification glowed at the top.

*@HostelReaper: The valve doesn't care about your schedule.*

I stared at it until the screen dimmed, then tapped it, then regretted tapping it. The message sat there alone, no avatar, no follow button, just those words. I wanted to pretend it was a coincidence. I wanted to pretend I didn't know what a valve sounded like when it turned. I was too awake to lie.

From the top bunk, Jessa shifted, murmured something in her sleep. The dorm was mostly dark, a few people breathing in their own little bubbles. Someone's phone alarm was set for 6:00 and went off in a tinny chirp. I couldn't decide if I should be relieved or furious that the gas was back on. The hot water would shut people up, which meant fewer refunds, which meant Pedro would sleep better. The gas on meant the kitchen was a stage again, the lights back on, the props live. The brand would be happy. So would the part of me that kept pretending fear was just a prop.

I slid out of bed and pulled on my hoodie. In the hallway, the air was warmer than it should have been at dawn. I paused outside the kitchen door. The sign was still taped there, but the tape had been peeled back and pressed on again, a scar. *KITCHEN CLOSED. GAS LEAK. NO SMOKING.* Someone had scribbled *OPEN* in pen underneath, then crossed it out. The paper fluttered with each breath of the building.

Inside, the hiss was back.

It wasn't loud yet. It was like a whisper from behind a wall, the sound of someone trying to breathe without being heard. I told myself it was the stove being old, the pipes shifting. I told myself the gas company had fixed something overnight, which was nonsense because gas companies don't do miracles at 3 AM. I told myself a lot of things as I walked past the kitchen and toward the bathroom.

The water was steaming from the shower stall. Dylan stood there in a towel, hair dripping, skin turning pink from heat. He grinned when he saw me like we were old friends.

"Hot water's back," he said. "Blessed." His accent was broad Australian, vowels stretched like he'd already started his day at the beach.

"Since when?" I asked.

He shrugged. "Got up to pee, heard pipes. Thought I'd take advantage before they change their minds." He glanced toward the kitchen door. "Smells rank again though. Like, proper egg fart. You guys still messing with that?"

"Not me," I said, and hated how reflexive it was.

He laughed, unbothered, and walked past me toward the dorm. The damp heat from the shower hung in the air. I went in anyway. I turned the water on and waited for it to warm. It took five seconds. That was too fast. I stood under it like a person under a confession and let my shoulders loosen. The steam did what steam always does: it made everything feel softer, safer, more temporary. I closed my eyes. The scent of gas slipped in under the soap, quiet as a rumour. I breathed through it because I always do.

When I got back to the dorm, my phone was buzzing again. The brand rep.

*Need final deliverable this morning. We have approvals on hold. You can do it, right?*

I typed *Yes* and deleted it. I typed *Maybe* and deleted it. I typed nothing and watched the cursor blink like a pulse. The hot water had made me brave for five minutes, like a drink. The bravery drained fast.

Jessa sat up, rubbing her face. "Why are you showering at dawn?" she mumbled.

"Because the gas is on," I said.

Her eyes opened a fraction more. "It's on?"

"Hot water," I said, as if that was the same thing as safe.

She looked past me toward the hallway, toward the kitchen. "That's not good."

"It's fine," I said, and the lie was sharp in my throat. I tried to smile. "If anything, it means it's fixed."

"That's not how that works." She swung her legs down. "You sure Pedro didn't just..."

"Turn it back on?" I finished for her. I shrugged. "Would he?"

She didn't answer. We both knew.

Rafa popped her head through the doorway, hair in a messy bun, ring light under one arm like a weapon. "Gas is back," she said. "Someone tell me this is a good sign."

"It's a sign," I said.

"Of what?"

"Of hot showers," I said, then regretted it.

Rafa stepped inside, eyes on my face. "You're going to do it, aren't you?"

"I have to," I said, and my voice sounded like the clip of a door locking.

She put the ring light down on an empty bunk and rubbed her forehead. "Okay. Then we do it fast. We do it smart. We don't use the back burner. We keep the door open. We get in, get out. Ten minutes."

"Ten seconds," I said.

She didn't laugh. "Sienna."

I wanted to tell her I could hear the hiss in my head, that it was louder than the shower, louder than my own pulse. I wanted to tell her the brand rep had the power to evict me from my life. I wanted to tell her I couldn't afford to be brave in any way except the stupid one. I said, "It's just a shot." The words tasted like pennies.

She sighed. "Fine. But if I say stop, you stop."

"Sure," I said, and meant it the way you mean a promise to someone you love when you already know you'll break it.

---

By seven, the lobby was awake and grumbling. The smell of gas had crept back into the hallway like a cat that belonged there. People were queuing for the bathroom, and for once the mood was almost cheerful. Hot water is a gift that makes you forget the cost of it. I walked down to the kitchen, phone in my hand, and found Joana standing by the door with a coffee she wasn't drinking.

She looked at me, then past me, then at the ceiling like she was counting down.

"It's back on," I said.

"I know," she said, and her voice was flat. "He turned it on at six. He said guests were furious."

"You let him?"

"He owns the valve. I own a student loan." She took a slow breath. "I called the gas company. They said they will come today. They said that yesterday."

"So it's okay until they come?" I asked, and even as I said it I knew how stupid it sounded.

She stared at me. "No. It's not okay now. It wasn't okay yesterday. It is less okay when you light things."

I glanced at the sign. Someone had pulled it down and taped it back up crooked. Someone had added a new note beneath it in blue pen: *NO SMOKING.* The letters were heavier, pressed into the paper like someone had tried to carve them.

"I'm not lighting anything," I said.

Joana's eyes flicked to the ring light case on my shoulder, to the phone in my hand, to the cigarette that wasn't in my hand. She looked so tired that I almost told her the truth. Instead I said, "I'm just getting water."

"Get it and go," she said. "Don't linger."

Inside, the kitchen was already warm with bodies. Yuki stood at the counter, rice cooker open, steam rising. Lucas was filling a bottle at the sink. Dylan leaned against the table, hair still damp, scrolling with one thumb, barefoot, looking like a postcard of a surfer who had gotten lost in a tile museum.

The smell hit me like a memory. Sweet, chemical, wrong. It had a thickness to it now, like the air had been simmering all night. I took a breath anyway because it was the only way to keep moving.

"Gas is back," Dylan said without looking up. "Good for showers, bad for lungs."

Lucas snorted. "He turned it on?" His accent bent the words. He shook his head. "He is crazy." He nodded toward the stove. "That thing is a bomb."

"Maybe the gas company fixed it," I said, and even I didn't believe me.

Yuki turned toward me, her face soft. "It is worse today," she said. "My head hurts." She pressed two fingers to her temple. "Maybe we should not use it."

She said it gently, like a suggestion about where to sit on a bus. I smiled, because that's what I do when people are kind to me.

"Don't worry," I said. "I'm not cooking." Then I picked up a glass and filled it with water to give my hands something safe to do.

The hiss behind the stove rose and fell, a small mechanical sigh. The window was still painted shut, the morning light flattened against the glass like it wanted in. The exhaust fan above the stove was a decorative circle, silent, dead. The blue tiles glowed, smug in the light that made them look expensive. I watched them like a person watches a mirror they don't trust.

Dylan pocketed his phone. "You filming something?" he asked, nodding at my phone.

"Maybe," I said.

"Maybe don't in here," he said, and he said it with a smile, like a joke. The joke didn't land. He scratched the back of his neck. "Sorry. It's just, like, the smell, yeah?"

"I'll be quick," I said. The words were automatic, a promise I'd made a hundred times to myself and never kept.

Lucas pointed at the sign. "It says no smoking," he said. He didn't look at me. He was staring at the tiles like they might start moving.

"I don't smoke," I said, which was almost true, which is the kind of truth I live on.

Yuki closed her rice cooker and lifted it with both hands. "I will eat outside," she said. "Fresh air."

"Smart," Dylan said, and followed her out.

Lucas lingered. He took a bottle of water and hesitated. "You are Sienna, yes?" he asked.

"Yeah," I said, startled.

"I saw you on the roof last night. You are famous?" He looked politely curious, not impressed.

"Not really," I said. "Just... on the internet."

He nodded like that explained nothing. "Be careful," he said, and then left too.

The room went quiet. The hiss filled the space. My water tasted metallic. I set the glass down and stood very still, waiting for the dizziness to pass. It didn't. It rolled through me slowly, a tide in my head.

The ring light case was heavy against my shoulder. I told myself this was the perfect time, the kitchen empty, the light clean, the gas back on because it was fixed. I told myself the dizziness was hunger. I told myself the world was always a little tilted, I just noticed it now because I was paying attention to everything except the thing that mattered.

Rafa pushed the door open with her hip, ring light stand clattering in her hands. She froze when she smelled it, her face tightening. "It's strong," she said.

"It's fine," I said.

She didn't argue. She just started unfolding the stand with the brisk efficiency of a person who knows arguing wastes time. The metal legs clicked against the tile. I could hear the hiss rise, as if the kitchen was telling us to hurry.

"Door stays open," she said, and used her foot to prop it wider.

"The light," I said automatically.

"We'll make it work," she said. "No one is dying for a shadow."

I wanted to tell her that I was, that the shadow was the thing I was always trying to escape. I pulled the ring light out and plugged it in. It hummed to life, a soft electric buzz that competed with the hiss. The tiles looked even bluer, more obedient. My reflection in the phone screen looked like a girl who had slept eight hours and believed in safety.

Rafa set the phone on a coffee cup to get the angle. "Where's the cigarette?"

"In my bag," I said, and my fingers were already moving.

She shot me a look. "We are not lighting it. We are just holding it, okay? We can add smoke in post."

"The brand wants flame," I said.

"The brand can want a unicorn," she said. "You're not lighting that in here."

We stared at each other, the tension a taut string. She was right. I knew she was right. I hated her for it, loved her for it, wanted her to stop me and also wanted her to leave.

My phone buzzed on the table. The screen lit with a new message.

*If you can get the lighter in frame with real flame, we can push for a bonus.*

The brand rep had followed my silence with a carrot. The word *bonus* glittered like a coin in a fountain. I thought of my bank app, the red number, the late fee. I thought of my mother saying, *If it feels wrong, you leave.* I thought of Lisbon rent prices, of flights, of my dad's silence. The hiss behind the stove rose in the background like a laugh.

"Sienna," Rafa said, seeing my face. "Don't."

"It's just a flame," I said.

"It's just gas," she replied, and the sarcasm was raw. "We can leave. We can do it outside."

I wanted to scream that outside had already failed, that the brand wanted *this* kitchen, *this* light, *this* stupid danger. I wanted to scream that I was tired of being flexible. Instead I said, "Five seconds."

"No," she said. Her voice was low, firm. "I'm serious."

The door creaked. I turned. Joana stood in the hallway, coffee abandoned, eyes hard. "What are you doing?" she asked.

"Nothing," I said, too fast.

Her gaze dropped to the ring light, the phone, the cigarette in my hand like a tell. "I told you," she said. "No. Not here."

"We are just filming," Rafa said, trying to smooth it. "No flame."

"No filming," Joana said. "No people. Get out." She pointed toward the door. "Now."

I wanted to argue, to plead, to use the word *job* like it was a shield. I didn't. The look on her face was the look of a person who had already seen the end and was trying to drag us back from it by the collar. I swallowed my pride and turned off the ring light. The hiss had become a steady, annoyed whisper. The air felt thick, chewy. I tasted metal again.

We packed up in silence. As we passed Joana, she leaned in and said, low, "He turned it on because of reviews. He does not care if you die." It wasn't dramatic. It was tired.

Outside in the courtyard, the air felt thinner. Rafa exhaled hard. "He's going to get someone killed," she said.

"He already almost did," I said.

She looked at me. "So why are we doing this?"

I opened my mouth. I could have said money. I could have said pride. I could have said a million tiny reasons. Instead I said, "Because I said I would." It was the worst reason, and it was mine.

We went up to the roof anyway, because what else do you do when you are told no? The light was brutal and clean, the city stretching wide and indifferent. I filmed a few shots to calm myself: the river like a blade, the tram like a toy, Rafa's face in the sun. It didn't help. The kitchen lived under my skin, its blue tiles a map in my mind.

When we went back down, Maria was in the hallway with her cart, a bucket sloshing, her wrists red from scrubbing. She smelled faintly of bleach and lemon, the only clean scent the building had left. She nodded at us and then pointed her mop toward the kitchen with a frown.

"He turned it on again," she said, in English that came out like a sigh.

"Pedro?" I asked.

She crossed herself quickly, touching her forehead and chest. "Pedro, pipes, devils. All the same." She tried to smile, then shook her head. "In my mother's house, when we smell gas, we leave. No photo. No coffee. Just leave."

The way she said it made the word *leave* feel like a door I couldn't open. "They say it's fixed," I said, knowing she wouldn't believe me.

Maria made a sound like a laugh, but it was hollow. "Fixed when the meter is fixed," she said, meaning *paid*. She lifted the mop and pushed open the kitchen door with her foot. The hiss spilled into the hallway, a little louder in the open air, like it wanted witnesses. Maria muttered a prayer under her breath and went in anyway.

I followed her to the threshold. On the counter, someone had left a folded paper with a blue stamp. I picked it up before I could stop myself. It was a gas company notice, half in Portuguese, half in English.

**DANGER: GAS LEAK DETECTED. SHUT OFF SUPPLY. DO NOT USE APPLIANCES.**

The letters were bold and cold. Someone had drawn a smiley face in the corner, a tourist's attempt at humor. I felt my stomach drop. I set the paper back down like it burned.

In the lobby, Joana was on the phone again, her voice tight. She covered the receiver when she saw me. "Did you see the notice?" she asked.

"Yeah," I said.

"Then you understand," she said, and there was a plea in it. "Don't film. Don't cook. Don't be in there."

"Pedro turned it on," I said.

She nodded once, a sharp motion. "He says the inspector can't stop him. He says we need hot water for reviews. He says he will handle the risk. He says a lot of things." Her mouth pressed into a line. "I don't want to be here. But I am here. You can choose."

I didn't answer because the choice was a whole staircase I didn't want to climb.

Pedro walked through the lobby a moment later, phone in hand, his smile already in place. "We have no problems," he said to whoever was on the other end. He saw me and switched to English without missing a beat. "Sienna! Good morning. The water is hot again. Guests are happy. A small issue, nothing."

I held his gaze. "The gas company left a notice," I said.

He waved a hand. "They always leave notices. They want to sell services. Old buildings, you know." He patted my shoulder, a friendly, claiming touch. "If you need anything, you tell me."

I wanted to tell him to shut it off. I wanted to ask him if he had daughters. I wanted to tell him he was an idiot. I nodded instead, a small bob of the head that kept the peace and fed the lie.

Rafa tugged my sleeve. "Come on," she said. "Let's get breakfast somewhere else."

We walked down to a bakery that smelled like butter and burnt sugar. The pastel de nata were glossy, the coffee bitter. I ate like a person in a movie who eats to prove they're okay. Rafa watched me between sips, her eyes sliding back to the door every time it opened.

"We should leave," she said finally.

"We can't," I said, and then corrected myself. "I can't. You can."

"I'm not leaving you here alone," she said. She said it like a fact, not a promise.

There was a clock on the wall above the counter, its second hand ticking loud. Time felt like a tap on my shoulder. The brand rep's email sat in my inbox like a debt collector. I took out my phone and stared at my bank app. Red numbers. Overdraft. The kind of negative that feels like a stain.

"They'll cancel," I said.

Rafa leaned forward. "And what happens if they do? You go home. You get a job. You take a breath. You live."

"That's not living," I said, the words sharp. I hated them as soon as they left my mouth.

She didn't argue. She just looked tired. "Okay," she said. "Then we do it smart. If you insist, we do it smart."

We walked back up the hill and the smell hit us before we opened the door, the building leaking its secret into the street. Inside, the air was thick again. The lobby fan pushed it around uselessly. The kitchen door was propped open with a chair. Someone had wedged a towel under it as if that could keep anything out.

I went to the courtyard for a minute just to breathe. The lemon tree was dropping leaves, each one a little yellow curl. A cat walked the wall, tail high, eyes half-lidded. It paused above the kitchen window and jumped away, quick, as if it had heard something.

At noon, the gas company still hadn't come. By three, the complaints started again, the hot water mysteriously gone, the valve possibly turned off by someone more afraid than Pedro. By five, it was on again. The building kept cycling between danger and discomfort like a pendulum. Every time the water warmed, the smell sharpened. Every time the smell sharpened, I told myself I had a window of time to get the shot.

Pedro walked through the common room that evening, clapping hands, smiling wide. "We have fixed it," he said in English, in Portuguese, in whatever language he thought would stick. Behind him, the kitchen door was open. The sign was gone.

Joana stood at the desk and didn't look at him. Her fingers were white around the pen.

"You're going to get someone killed," Rafa muttered.

"Maybe he thinks it's good PR," I said. It was a joke and it wasn't. I watched Pedro watch me, the way he paused a beat longer than he needed to, the way his smile asked for my endorsement. I gave it, because he had the power to shut my life off in a different way.

When I checked my phone, there was another DM.

*@HostelReaper: He turned it back on. You still turned it into content.*

I blocked the account again. It didn't help. It never did. The message lived in my head now, louder than the hiss.

That night, I sat on my bunk and watched the light move across the ceiling as the streetlamps flickered outside. I could hear the kitchen two floors down like a distant ocean. My throat felt raw. I kept swallowing, tasting gas where there was none, a phantom smell. I set my alarm for 5:55 again. I told myself I wouldn't go. I told myself I would.

Rafa crawled into the bunk below mine and whispered, "If you go, wake me."

"Okay," I whispered back. I meant it. I also knew I wouldn't.

---

At 5:43, the gas was on.

I knew because the shower in the hallway hissed awake and someone cursed in French and then laughed. I knew because the air in the dorm was sweet and wrong. I knew because my phone was already in my hand before my eyes were open, the alarm a useless buzz I had turned off by muscle memory. The brand rep had sent a final message at 2:11 AM: *This is the last window. If we don't get the shot, we pull the campaign.*

There are sentences that do what a gun does. That one did.

I slipped out of bed and pulled on my hoodie. The lighter was in my toiletry bag; I took it out and felt the weight of it in my palm. It was warm, as if it had been waiting. I told myself I was just going to set up. I told myself I wouldn't light it. I told myself that if the smell was too strong, I'd leave. I told myself I would text Rafa.

I didn't.

The hallway was dim, the lights on a timer, the floor cool under my bare feet. The kitchen door was open. The sign was gone. The air inside was thick, a soup of mercaptan and old oil and coffee grounds. The hiss was louder than it had been the day before, a constant whisper like a crowd at a funeral.

The tiles were blue and white and clean, too beautiful for a room trying to kill me. The table waited in the center like a stage. Someone had left a spoon in the sink. The window was still painted shut. The exhaust fan was still dead. The stove sat there like a mouth with its teeth out.

I set my phone on the table and turned on the ring light. The halo filled the room with false daylight. The red record dot blinked. I looked at myself in the screen and saw a girl who could turn any situation into a story.

I placed the espresso cup on the table, the one I had borrowed from the café downstairs the day before and never returned. I set the cigarette beside it and adjusted the angle. The light hit the tiles just right, making them glow like they were lit from within. My heart was beating too fast. I told myself it was excitement.

A footstep in the hallway made me freeze. I killed the ring light, waited. No one came in. The hiss filled the space again, impatient. I turned the light back on, faster this time.

I took a breath. The air tasted like sulfur and sweetness, like a bad memory you keep chewing. My head felt light, a fraction unmoored. I smiled at the phone because that was what I did. I picked up the cigarette and placed it between my lips. I lifted the lighter and rolled it in my palm, feeling the ridges on the wheel.

The NO SMOKING sign was gone. The rules were gone. The only thing left was the light.

My thumb found the wheel. I closed my eyes for a second, not in prayer, but in focus. Ten seconds, I told myself. Ten seconds, and then I'd be out. Ten seconds, and I'd have the clip, the bonus, the proof that I could do it.

The hiss rose, steady and bored. The ring light hummed. The camera recorded.

Somewhere behind me, a floorboard creaked.

I opened my eyes.
