# Chapter 18: The Flame That Hesitates

The flame existed for half a second and I loved it too much.

It bloomed, clean and obedient, a perfect little blue tongue licking the air. The ring light caught it and turned it into a jewel. I could already see the story in my head: slow mornings, Lisbon tiles, a cigarette that said I was complicated. The hiss behind the stove rose in volume like someone leaning forward to hear better. The flame leaned too, as if the room itself were drawing it sideways.

My thumb froze. My brain didn't. The stupid part of me cataloged the shot—angle, glow, the way my hair caught the light—and the quieter part, the one I'd been drowning out with notifications, whispered, *that is not how flames move*.

The air felt wrong, thick as syrup. The blue flame shivered and flashed a brighter color, almost green, and for a split second I smelled something hotter than the gas, a sharp chemical sweetness like burning plastic before it burns. My head swam, the floor tilting like a boat. I kept smiling because the camera was rolling and because I am very good at smiling when I should be doing anything else.

The door flew open. Cold air slammed the flame sideways and snuffed it. Rafa stumbled in, hair pulled into a messy knot, ring light case banging her leg. She saw the cigarette between my lips and the lighter in my hand, and her face crumpled like she'd just seen a car crash happen in her kitchen.

"Jesus, Sienna," she said, breathless. "I said I'd be here. You couldn't even wait five minutes?"

The cigarette drooped, unlit again. My hand shook hard enough to make the lighter clack against the table. "I was waiting," I said, which wasn't exactly a lie. I had been waiting for the flame to behave, for the air to be normal, for someone else to make the choice so I didn't have to.

Rafa's eyes flicked to the stove, then to the floor, then back to my face. The smell hit her too; I watched it in her expression like a delayed reaction. "We need to get out of here," she said.

"It's fine," I said, because the words are automatic. I had rehearsed them for days.

"It's not fine," she said. "The air feels thick. Do you not feel it?"

I did. My cheeks tingled. The part of my brain that does captions tried to call it *a vibe*. The part of my brain that wants to keep breathing didn't have a word for it.

The ring light hummed. The red dot on the phone blinked, blind to everything except the shot. I reached to stop the recording, and my fingers brushed the screen, leaving a smeared fingerprint across my own face.

"Don't do this," Rafa said. She wasn't asking anymore. "Not today. Not in here. Come outside. We can fake it. You love smoke filters, right? Use one. We'll do it on the roof with a candle. We'll do it on a balcony. We'll do it in a bathroom with a fan. Anything but this."

"It won't look the same," I said, and heard how dumb it sounded. Like a girl complaining about lighting while the building exhaled poison.

Rafa stepped around the table, reached for my hand, and closed my fingers over the lighter. Her palm was warm, her grip sure. "You are not worth a cigarette," she said, and the words landed like a slap in a church. She wasn't talking about the prop. She was talking about me.

In the hallway, footsteps. Joana appeared in the doorway, hair still damp from a shower, her face drawn. She saw me, the ring light, the cigarette, and her jaw clenched so tight the muscle jumped.

"I told you," she said, voice low. She was past anger. She was into the cold part that scares you more because it means she has already imagined the consequences. "Out. Now."

Rafa moved first, tugging me to my feet. I grabbed my phone, my lighter, my cigarette, my pride. The tiles stared at me as I left, blue eyes in a white face. The smell followed us into the hallway like a hand on the back of my neck.

When we reached the courtyard, the air felt like forgiveness. I gulped it down greedily, as if it could rinse the chemical taste out of my mouth. My hands were still shaking. Rafa leaned against the wall, eyes closed, sucking in breath. The lemon tree above us dropped a leaf onto her shoulder and she flinched like she'd been hit.

"You scared me," she said finally.

"You scared me too," I said, because I'd seen it in her face. I'd seen, for a second, what it might look like to watch someone you know disappear in a white flash.

She opened her eyes. "Let's just—" She waved a hand toward the roof, toward the sky. "Let's get light that's not trying to kill us." Her voice cracked on the last word, and she pretended it didn't.

We went up to the roof anyway, ring light forgotten. The city was still mostly asleep, the river a band of dull silver. The air up here tasted clean and sharp, like metal and morning. I filmed anyway, because when you have a camera in your hand, it is hard to stop. Rafa sat beside me and let me take a shot of her against the sunrise, and I took a shot of her cigarettes hidden in her bag, because it felt like a joke only I could tell.

My phone buzzed. A notification from the brand: *Any updates? Need the morning ritual shot by tonight.* There was a thumbs-up emoji that felt like a weapon.

I didn't reply. I couldn't decide if silence was rebellion or cowardice. I turned the phone face down and watched the city wake up, trams clattering, gulls yelling, the smell of coffee rising from streets I couldn't see. Somewhere below us, the kitchen hissed.

---

By eight, the gas company truck still hadn't come. It was a white van with a blue logo that existed only in Joana's texts. She called again, leaning against the reception desk, speaking in fast Portuguese I couldn't follow. Her tone climbed and fell like a wave. When she hung up, she looked at me and Rafa like we were two weights on her shoulders.

"They say midday now," she said. "Maybe."

"Maybe is not a plan," Rafa said.

"Maybe is all they give us," Joana replied. She rubbed her forehead, then pasted on a smile as a group of newly arrived German boys with matching backpacks walked in. "Bom dia!" she chirped, and I watched her switch from worry to hospitality like flipping a coin.

Pedro appeared from the back office, buttoning his shirt, his hair still wet. He took in the lobby with a practiced glance and then focused on me the way people with money always do. "Sienna!" he said, spreading his arms as if I'd walked into his home. "We saw your rooftop photo. Beautiful. The light in our hostel is very special."

"So special it might explode," Rafa muttered under her breath.

Pedro didn't hear her. Or he chose not to. "We have a maintenance situation," he said, smile fixed. "It will be resolved quickly. We are very responsible." The words came out in English, in the polite, over-enunciated tone of someone accustomed to reviews.

Joana's eyes flared. "We need to close the kitchen until they come," she said. "It's not safe."

Pedro lowered his voice. "If we close it, people demand refunds," he said. "Do you want that?" He said it like the answer was obviously no. He said it like he was protecting us from the consequences of safety.

"I want them to be alive to demand refunds," she said. The German boys looked up, confused. Pedro waved a hand and steered them toward the stairs.

He walked back to the office and left the argument standing in the lobby like a bad smell. Joana watched him go, jaw clenched, and then reached for a roll of tape and another sign. She wrote in block letters: *KITCHEN CLOSED. GAS LEAK. NO SMOKING.* She added the Portuguese underneath. Her handwriting shook just enough to make the letters look angry.

I watched her tape it to the door and thought about how signs are the cheapest kind of responsibility. You put the sign up, and if anyone gets hurt, you can say you tried. I had learned that on the internet. I had done the same with disclaimers and affiliate disclosures, little warnings at the bottom of a post that let you keep the money and the innocence. It never works the way you hope.

Rafa nudged me. "Come get coffee," she said. "Real coffee. And no, the hostel coffee doesn't count."

We walked down the hill to a cafe that smelled like burnt sugar and orange peel. The espresso machine hissed in a way that made my shoulders tense. Rafa laughed at me and pressed my hand. "Different hiss," she said. "Less murder."

We took our coffees to a small table by the window. The sunlight came in low and golden, the kind of light I usually chased, the kind that makes people look kinder than they are. I filmed the coffee anyway, because the instinct doesn't die just because you think it should. Rafa took a bite of a pastel de nata and closed her eyes in a tiny, appreciative moment. I wanted to take a picture of that too, but it felt too real, too close. I let it be.

"We could pivot," she said. "Do the brand shot in a cafe. You can make it look like a kitchen. No one will know."

"They'll know," I said. "They asked for tiles. They asked for that blue-and-white look. It's the whole thing."

"Then find another set of tiles," she said, waving her spoon toward the city. "Lisbon is literally tiles. You're not trapped in that kitchen."

I wanted to tell her that it wasn't about the tiles. It was about the pressure. The contract. The panic. The feeling of slipping off the little rung I'd climbed and ending up back in my childhood bedroom with a stack of rejection emails. It was about the version of me that only exists in good light. It was about not disappointing a brand rep I'd never meet but who held my rent in their inbox.

"I just need ten seconds," I said. I said it to her, I said it to myself, I said it to the coffee on the table.

Rafa looked tired. "Ten seconds is how people die," she said, and then smiled like it was a joke because she didn't want to press the bruise.

On the street outside, a man was selling lighters and postcards. The lighters gleamed in a row, red and blue and gold. I watched them through the window like a person watching a shelf of tiny bombs. I already had one in my pocket. It felt heavier than it should. I sipped my coffee and tried to taste anything besides the chemical sweetness that lived at the back of my tongue.

My phone buzzed. Another message, another deadline. *Need final deliverable by 8 PM. Otherwise we reassign.* The email didn't say *please*. It didn't need to. The power dynamic was in the words *we reassign.* A phrase that meant: you are replaceable, your skin and your teeth and your light are not yours to hold onto if you don't perform.

I texted back with a smiley face and a lie. *Working on it now! Love this campaign. You'll have it.*

Rafa glanced at the screen. "You're doing it," she said.

"I have to," I said. The words sounded like a confession. In my mouth, they tasted like a dare.

We left the cafe and climbed the hill back toward the hostel. The air got thicker as we got closer, as if the building were radiating its own atmosphere. When we stepped into the lobby, the smell hit us and Rafa's shoulders rose toward her ears.

"It's worse," she said.

"It always is," I said.

The gas company van was finally parked outside, its blue logo dull in the light. Two men in coveralls were unloading a metal case and a small machine that looked like a vacuum. Joana stood on the threshold, talking quickly, her hands moving like she was trying to sculpt urgency out of the air.

Pedro appeared beside them, smiling too widely. He shook their hands, slapped one of them on the shoulder, laughed at something none of us could hear. When he saw me, he gestured grandly toward the kitchen, as if to say *see, I told you we were responsible*. I felt my face arrange itself into the polite smile I use for strangers who hold my future. It felt like a mask sliding into place.

The men went inside. The door closed. The sign stayed taped up, curling at the edges. We sat on the steps and waited. The sun climbed. The city went on. I kept touching the lighter in my pocket like it was a lucky coin.

After twenty minutes, the door opened again. The man with a mustache stepped out, his face serious. He said something in Portuguese to Joana that made her go pale. Pedro immediately stepped in, gesturing, smiling, talking fast. The man shook his head. He pointed to the stove, to the back wall, to the floor. He mimed opening windows. He mimed a flame bursting. He didn't have to mime much; his eyes did it for him.

Joana turned to Pedro, her mouth tight. "He says we have to shut the gas," she said. "He says it's dangerous." Her English was sharper now, as if she wanted me to understand the magnitude.

Pedro waved a hand. "He is being dramatic. He wants to sell us an upgrade," he said. He said it in a tone that pretended he was joking. He wasn't.

The man with the mustache stepped forward and held up the detector. The little machine squealed, a high, shrill noise that cut through the lobby like a knife. People froze. The German boys on the stairs stopped laughing. Rafa's eyes widened. The machine's needle swung to the red.

Pedro's smile faltered.

The man said one word in English: "Danger." He turned to his partner and they spoke quickly, then walked toward the main valve near the back storage door. Pedro stepped in front of them, blocking their path. His voice rose. Joana snapped back. The lobby became a triangle of tense bodies and rising heat.

"You cannot shut it," Pedro said. "We have guests. This is illegal."

The mustache man raised his eyebrows. "So is blowing up," he said. He moved around Pedro without touching him and shut the valve with a decisive twist.

There was a small, terrible silence afterward, as if the building had been holding its breath. Then the hiss faded. The smell didn't, not immediately, but it softened, like a tide going out.

I felt my knees go weak. Rafa gripped my arm. Joana exhaled so hard I could hear it.

Pedro glared at the men. "You will hear from me," he said, but his voice shook. The man just shrugged.

"We will be back when you fix it," he said. "No gas until then."

Pedro turned on his heel and disappeared into his office, door slamming. Joana leaned against the wall, eyes closed. The lobby was quiet, everyone processing the idea that they had been sharing air with an invisible threat. I thought about the flame in the kitchen that morning, how it had leaned sideways, how the air had felt like syrup. I wanted to laugh and throw up at the same time.

"No gas," Rafa said, as if to make sure she had heard it right.

"No gas," Joana confirmed. She opened her eyes and looked at me. "That means no stove. It also means no hot water. It means no..." She trailed off, the list too long to finish.

"It means no shot," Rafa said.

I should have felt relieved. I did, in a small, responsible corner of me. But a bigger part of me, the part trained to think in deliverables and deadlines, felt a panic so sharp it made my throat tighten. No gas meant no kitchen fire. No shot meant no payment. No payment meant no Lisbon, no next city, no life that looked like mine on a screen.

"We can do it elsewhere," Rafa said, reading my face. "We'll figure it out."

"We have until eight," I said. The words slipped out before I could stop them.

Rafa squeezed my arm. "Then we'll get something by eight. Not in there."

She was right. I knew she was right. I nodded like I meant it.

---

By afternoon, the hostel was a simmering stew of complaints. No hot showers meant no patience. People stomped down the stairs muttering in German and Spanish. The British stag party asked for a discount and got a polite shrug. Pedro posted an apology sign in three languages and smiled like a man selling a product that wasn't his.

The kitchen was closed, truly closed now, the stove cold, the hiss gone. Without the hiss, the kitchen felt uncanny, like a mouth with its teeth removed. The smell still lingered, stubborn, clinging to the tiles. The air was thinner, but the taste remained, a ghost on my tongue.

I went in anyway, just to see, just to make sure it was real. The ring light felt ridiculous in my hand without the gas to justify it. The tiles looked less magical in daylight. The window was still painted shut, a rectangle of trapped light. The stove sat there, innocent and ancient. The smell seemed to come from the floor itself.

"Don't," Joana said, appearing in the doorway. Her tone was softer now, tired. "We shut it for a reason."

"I'm not doing anything," I said. The lie was a habit. The truth was that I had a cigarette in my pocket and a deadline on my screen and no plan.

"You should leave," she said. "Go somewhere safe. The smell will fade. The company will come back. We will fix it." She smiled, a thin, hopeful thing. "Probably."

"I can't just leave," I said. "I..." I didn't finish. The words were too embarrassing to say to someone who had just fought with her boss over my safety.

She tilted her head. "It's money?"

I nodded, a little.

"Then take a photo outside," she said. "Lisbon is full of tiles. There is a church around the corner. It has tiles. They are very beautiful."

"It's not the same," I said, hating myself for it.

Joana sighed. "Your life is not a photo, Sienna." She said my name like it was a prayer. Then she left, and the room felt larger and emptier without her in it.

I sat at the table and opened my phone. I scrolled through the footage from the morning. The flame was there, a tiny jewel, caught for half a second before it died. I paused on the frame. My eyes were wide, my smile too fixed. The flame leaned sideways, as if pulled by a current. The shot was almost perfect. It was also almost a death.

I stared at it and thought about editing. I thought about how easy it would be to loop that half second and make it look like I had lit the cigarette. I could add a little smoke. I could cheat. I had cheated before, in small ways. Everyone did. It was part of the job. But the brand wanted a continuous shot, a ritual, an uncut moment. They had asked for authenticity, which is always a lie.

My phone buzzed with another email. *If you can't deliver the original, send whatever you can. But we need something.* The brand rep had moved from demand to negotiation. It felt like a crack in a door.

I stared at the crack and considered stepping through. I could take the half-second flame and build a lie from it. I could film myself on the roof with a candle, layer the frames, make something that looked like the kitchen. I could use the church tiles Joana mentioned. I could do the thing Rafa said and fake the smoke with an app.

But when I thought about posting a fake, something stubborn and petty in me rebelled. It wasn't pride. It wasn't integrity. It was the fear that if I started faking the big things, everything would turn fake, and then the only thing I would have left would be a feed of lies with my face on top. I already lived close to that edge. I didn't want to jump.

Rafa knocked on the door frame. "Come on," she said. "Let's go find tiles."

"Where?" I asked.

"There's a chapel two streets down with blue tiles on the outside," she said. "We can shoot there. We'll use a candle. We'll make it look like a kitchen."

"You can't make a chapel look like a kitchen," I said.

"You can make anything look like anything with the right framing," she said. She shook the ring light case in my direction. "That's your whole job."

I wanted to tell her it wasn't the same. I wanted to tell her the brand wanted *this* light, *this* tile, *this* smell that had become part of my skin. Instead I stood up and followed her because moving forward was easier than sitting in my panic.

We found the chapel. It was small, whitewashed, closed for the afternoon. The tiles on the outside were blue and white, floral, similar enough that a person on a phone might not notice the difference. Rafa set up the ring light on the sidewalk while tourists walked around us. The air smelled like roasted chestnuts and diesel. A tram clattered past, shaking the sidewalk. I perched on a low wall and held a cold coffee to mimic an espresso.

"Okay, cigarette," Rafa said.

"We can't smoke here," I said, nodding at a sign with a crossed-out cigarette.

She rolled her eyes. "So we're obeying *this* sign?"

"Yeah," I said. "There's no gas leak here to make me feel brave." It was a joke. It landed badly.

I held the cigarette unlit, fingers posed. Rafa filmed. I stared into the lens and tried to summon something like serenity. The light was good. The tiles were good. The shot was good enough. But I could feel the difference like a pebble in my shoe. The soundscape was wrong. The smell was wrong. The air didn't hum with danger. It was just a street in Lisbon on a Tuesday. It felt too safe to be interesting.

When we watched the footage, it looked like a person pretending to be the person I wanted to be. Which was, in a way, my entire job. I should have been used to that.

"It's fine," Rafa said.

"It's not," I said.

"It will be once you edit," she said, and I knew she was right. I knew I could make it work. But the pressure had shifted. Now I wasn't just chasing a shot. I was chasing the feeling the shot gave me: the feeling that I was braver than I was, that I could stand in a room that smelled like gas and smile into a camera and still come out the other side with money and likes. That feeling was addictive. It was the kind of addiction that doesn't show on blood tests.

We went back to the hostel. The smell was lighter now, the hiss gone, but it was still there, a reminder baked into the walls. The kitchen was empty, the table bare. I set the ring light down and wandered into the courtyard, where the lemon tree was dropping leaves like a slow confession.

Jessa was there, sitting on the low wall, scrolling through her phone. She looked up when I came in. "You okay?" she asked.

"Fine," I said, because I always do.

"You don't look fine," she said.

I sat beside her. The air felt cooler. The lemon tree smelled like clean skin. "They shut the gas," I said.

"Good," she said.

"It means no hot showers," I said, trying to laugh.

"I can live without hot showers," she said. She bumped her shoulder against mine. "I can't live without you."

The words hung there, heavier than they should have been for two people who'd known each other for days. My throat tightened. I hated how easy it was to be seen. I hated how much I wanted it.

"You're being dramatic," I said, and tried to smile. The smile didn't quite land.

"I'm being honest," she said. "And you're being stubborn."

She wasn't wrong. I wanted to be the girl who listened. I wanted to be the girl who could laugh off a brand rep and say no. I wanted to be the girl who could leave a hostel if it smelled like gas. I wasn't. I was the girl who said yes and then pretended it was a choice.

That night, I edited the chapel footage. I warmed the colors, deepened the blue, cropped out the street sign. I added a slow-motion effect on the cigarette as I lifted it. I built a lie from light and angles. It looked good. It looked like the kitchen. It looked like me.

I sent it to the brand rep with a caption about "Lisbon mornings" and a smiley face. I waited. The reply came an hour later: *Nice. But we need the kitchen shot. Campaign is specifically about home spaces. Can you still deliver?*

I stared at the words until they blurred. The lie wasn't enough. It never is. The goalposts had moved again, and I was expected to chase them.

Rafa peeked in. "How'd it go?"

"They want the kitchen," I said.

She swore softly. "But there's no gas now."

"There's no gas now," I repeated.

"Then it's safe," she said. "You can do it."

"They shut it off," I said. "But Pedro..." I trailed off. I had seen him earlier, speaking sharply into his phone, gesturing toward the back storage door. I had seen him glance at the valve, his face pinched. I had seen him close the door to his office and wondered what he'd do once the complaints got too loud. The man with the mustache had said *no gas until you fix it.* Pedro didn't like being told no.

"Pedro won't turn it back on," Rafa said, like she wanted to believe it.

"He might," I said. "He cares more about showers than safety."

"He can't just turn it back on," she said.

"He can," I said. "He's the owner." The word tasted like power and danger.

We sat in silence for a moment. The dorm was loud with the noises of people adjusting to cold water. In the hallway, someone banged on a door and cursed in French. The smell of gas was faint now, but still there, like a memory in the walls.

My phone buzzed with a notification I didn't recognize. An Instagram DM from a new account. No avatar. No posts. The handle was a string of numbers.

*You got a warning and still want the light.*

My stomach dropped. I stared at the screen, then at Rafa. I showed it to her. She frowned.

"Block it," she said.

"I did," I said. "Last night."

She shrugged. "People are bored." She tried to laugh, but the sound was thin.

I didn't reply. I didn't block it either. I took a screenshot and slid the phone face down, like the words might bite.

"Let's just do the shot in the kitchen when it's safe," Rafa said. "If the gas is off, the risk is off. We can do it tomorrow morning. We'll do it fast. We'll do it together."

"Tomorrow morning," I repeated. The words felt like a trap. Tomorrow was always a promise and a threat.

Rafa yawned and climbed into her bunk. "Get some sleep," she said. "You look wrecked."

I lay on my bed, staring at the ceiling. The smell of gas had faded, but my body still expected it. My tongue still tasted metal. My head still ached. I set my alarm for 5:55 out of habit, then turned it off. Then turned it back on. I was making a decision by not making one.

Somewhere downstairs, a door closed. Somewhere in the walls, the building settled, a low groan like a throat clearing. I thought about the flame that morning, the way it had leaned. I thought about the valve, shut. I thought about Pedro's face, the way he looked at the kitchen like it was a stage he refused to close.

At midnight, I got up to pee and passed the kitchen door on my way to the bathroom. The sign was still taped there, but it had been peeled and reattached, the tape wrinkled. I paused, listening. No hiss. Just the old wood creaking. I pressed my palm to the door. It was cool, still. Safe.

In my room, I pulled the lighter from my pocket and flicked it once, just to see. The flame rose clean, steady, indifferent. It felt less like a promise and more like a dare. I closed it quickly and lay back down, the lighter warm in my hand.

The message on my phone sat like a splinter. *You got a warning and still want the light.* I shut my eyes and saw the kitchen tiles, the ring light, the blue flame leaning sideways.

Tomorrow morning, I told myself. If the gas stayed off, it would be safe. If Pedro didn't turn it back on, it would be fine. If the brand rep wasn't lying, it would be worth it. If the warning was just a troll, it didn't matter.

I set the lighter on the nightstand like a rosary. I set my alarm for 5:55. I told myself I would be careful. I told myself the air would be honest.

Outside, Lisbon breathed in the dark. Inside, the hostel held its breath.
