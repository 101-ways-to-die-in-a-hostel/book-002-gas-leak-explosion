# Chapter 14: The Air Keeps Notes

The smell was in my hair when I woke up, as if it had been braiding itself into my sleep.

My alarm hadn't gone off yet. The dorm was still a dark aquarium, the snores of strangers floating through it like lazy fish. I lay there and let my eyes adjust, counting the seconds between the building's tiny creaks. The air felt thick, heavy enough to press against my ribs when I inhaled. I told myself that was just the blanket. Then the faint sweetness of mercaptan slid in anyway, a rotten sugar that made my stomach tilt.

My phone buzzed once, the soft spider-leg of a notification. I checked it under the blanket like a teenager hiding contraband. The email subject line was a bright, cheerful threat: *Need the shot by Friday.*

Underneath, the brand rep had written: *Love the tiles. Can we get the cigarette lit? It feels more authentic. Think "European morning ritual."*

Authentic. I almost laughed. My morning ritual was dry shampoo and a credit card statement. But I replied *Yes!!* because that's what you do when your paycheck depends on a mood.

I rolled over and my fingers hit the lighter. The plastic was warm from my phone. The cigarette was still tucked in the elastic of my journal, unlit, innocent. I stared at them and felt the strange calm of a person who has already decided something and just hasn't told herself yet.

---

In the hallway, the smell grew teeth.

The kitchen door was cracked open, a slice of blue light spilling into the corridor. I stepped through and the tiles swallowed me. Joana was there, hair pinned up, cardigan over her pajamas. She had propped the courtyard door open with a chair, like a barricade against the air. A kettle sat on the front burner, the flame a stubborn little blue tongue. She didn't look at me when I came in, just said, "Morning," as if that word could cover everything else.

"Morning," I said back. The word tasted wrong.

The smell pooled low, dense enough that my ankles felt like they were walking through fog. It was stronger than yesterday. It was so strong I could feel it on my tongue. I kept my mouth closed and breathed through my nose because it felt more polite, which is a ridiculous reason to do anything.

Joana was wiping the counter in short, angry strokes. The NO SMOKING sign had a new layer of tape over it, as if someone had tried to make it more official by making it uglier. The handwritten note on the back burner had been replaced with an actual printed sign, still crooked: *FORA DE SERVIÇO - GÁS*. Out of service. Gas.

"Gas company?" I asked.

She shook her head. "They said maybe late afternoon." She said it like she didn't believe in afternoons anymore.

"Pedro?"

She made a noise that was not a word. "He said we can keep using the front burners. He says to open the door." She gestured at the courtyard like it was a ritual.

I looked at the door, at the lemon tree outside shivering in the morning breeze. The chair was jammed into the threshold, the way you jam a chair against a doorknob in a horror movie.

"So you're telling people?" I asked.

"I put the sign," she said. "What else can I do?" She finally looked at me. Her eyes were tired in the way that makes you feel guilty for being young. "Please," she added. "No smoking. Not even for a photo. Do you understand?"

I wanted to say yes. I wanted to say I would never be that stupid, I wanted to say I cared about my lungs more than my likes. Instead I said, "Of course," because that is what you say to people who are worried about you, even if you are about to disappoint them.

She studied my face, probably deciding if I was lying. Then she looked away and picked up the kettle. The flame under it flickered, then stabilized, like even the fire was indecisive.

"If you feel dizzy," she said, softer now, "go outside. I mean it. Not to the hallway. Outside." She said it the way you tell someone where the exits are before a show starts, not because you expect a fire, but because the building requires you to.

"I'm fine," I said.

And that was probably the most honest thing I said all morning, because in that moment I believed it.

Rafa slipped in behind me, still in her jacket, eyes heavy. She had a ring light under one arm and a paper cup of espresso in the other. The smell hit her and she made a face, then smoothed it into a smile when she saw me. "We're really doing this?" she whispered.

"Quick," I said. "Unlit first. We'll see."

Rafa raised her eyebrows, the same look she gives when someone offers her free prosecco at a work event. She put her coffee down and set up the ring light anyway. The light turned on with a flicker. The tiles woke up.

The kitchen transformed in that artificial glow. The cracks in the grout disappeared. The warning tape softened into a blur. The gas smell didn't leave, but it stepped back, like it didn't want to be in the shot.

We positioned the table by the courtyard door for "natural" light. The chair stayed in the doorway, holding the door open, a bouncer for fresh air. I put the espresso cup in front of me, a prop from the machine downstairs that I would not drink. I laid the cigarette on the saucer like it belonged there. I tried to keep my hand steady as I placed the lighter beside it.

"Okay," Rafa said, checking her phone screen. "Slow movements. We want, like, languid. European. Think movie." She grinned. "You're born for this."

I laughed because that's what you do when someone flatters you. It hides the fact that my head was already starting to ache, a low-pressure bloom behind my eyes.

We did the unlit takes. Me lifting the cup, me leaning in as if to smell the coffee, me holding the cigarette between my fingers like a prop in a period drama. I was aware, the whole time, of the smell. It hovered at the edge of the frame, an invisible extra in every shot.

"Let's do the lighter," Rafa said after the third take. "Just the click. You don't have to light it. We can add smoke later." She said it like a compromise, like a treaty.

My thumb found the wheel. The metal ridges bit into my skin. I angled the lighter in the light, watched the red plastic gleam, the branded logo like a tiny badge of shame. I flicked it once, not hard enough for a spark, just a click that sounded huge in the quiet room.

The hiss behind the stove answered.

I froze with the lighter half-raised, the click still hanging in the air. The hiss was louder than it had been yesterday. It was no longer a whisper. It sounded like an exhale through teeth, like a warning through a grin.

"Did you hear that?" Rafa asked.

"The fridge," I said. "It always does that." I didn't know if I was right. I just knew I needed to be right.

Rafa squinted toward the stove. The warning tape on the back burner trembled slightly, like it was breathing. She looked at me again. "Maybe we don't do this now."

I felt a surge of irritation, the kind that comes when someone tries to pull you back from a cliff you didn't realize you were standing on. "It's fine," I said. "We can do it fast."

"Fast isn't the same as safe," she said, and there was a new tone in her voice, not teasing now.

Joana walked back in with a tray of pastries, heard the hiss, and froze. She put the tray down with more force than necessary. "I said no smoking," she said, and this time her voice was not a plea. It was a line in concrete.

"We're not smoking," I said, holding up the unlit cigarette like a peace offering. "Just a shot."

"The gas doesn't know the difference," she said. The words cut through the room. She looked at Rafa. "Tell her."

Rafa raised her hands. "We're done," she said quickly. "We got enough."

Joana stared at me, waiting.

I felt all the eyes in the room, and the smell in my throat, and the stupid little cigarette in my fingers, and I hated that I was the villain in this story. I put the lighter down. "Fine," I said. "We'll do it later."

Joana's shoulders dropped a fraction, like she'd been holding up a ceiling.

We packed up. The ring light went dark. The tiles lost their halo. The room became a kitchen again, with peeling paint and a sour smell, not a set.

"Sorry," I muttered as I passed Joana. It wasn't enough, but it was what I had.

She nodded once. "Please," she said, and I didn't know if it was a thank you or a warning.

---

By late morning, the hostel was awake and loud. The common room smelled like damp socks and instant coffee. Someone was watching a Portuguese reality show with the sound too high. I sat at the corner table with my laptop and my headache and pretended they were both temporary.

I scrubbed through the footage, hunting for moments where the light looked like a promise. The ring light had caught the tiles just right. The smear of my lip gloss looked expensive. The cigarette, unlit, still suggested a story. I could fake the smoke, I told myself. I could add it later, layer it in, make it real enough for a brand rep who had never been here and never would.

My phone buzzed again. An Instagram DM: *Girl, that kitchen smell like gas??* It was from a girl I had met in Prague who now only existed as a thumbnail in my inbox. I typed *Haha it's just old pipes* and hit send, because that was the story I was telling myself too.

Felix dropped into the chair across from me without asking. He was holding a camera in one hand and a small paper bag in the other. He set the bag on the table and slid it toward me. Inside was a pastel de nata, still warm. The smell was clean, sweet. It made my mouth ache.

"You look like you're about to cry," he said.

"I always look like this in the morning," I said.

"That's a lie," he said. His eyes flicked to the screen. "You got what you need?"

I hesitated. "Almost."

"There's a cafe near Mouraria with tiles and sun. You could go now." He said it gently, like he was offering an alternative, not a rescue.

I broke the pastry open and let the heat fog my fingers. The custard was bright and messy, the opposite of my photos. "It's not the same," I said.

"Neither is blowing up," he said.

I laughed, because the line was absurd and because if I didn't laugh I'd have to feel the truth of it. "You think I'm going to blow up?"

He didn't smile. "I think you don't want to be wrong. That's different." He leaned back. "Joana asked me to tell you to go to a coworking space today. She said the smell is worse."

"She asked you?" I asked.

"Everyone's talking about it," he said. "You're just the only one who keeps going into that kitchen at dawn."

I wanted to say *It's my job.* I wanted to say *You don't understand.* I wanted to say *Everything I do is a performance.* Instead I said, "It's fine."

He sighed. "You keep saying that." He tilted his head. "Do you actually believe it?"

I looked down at my hands. My nails were perfect. My knuckles were pale. My head throbbed. I could hear the faint hiss even from here, or maybe I was imagining it. The building had a soundtrack now, a note I couldn't unhear.

"I have to get the shot," I said, which was not an answer to his question.

He studied me for a long beat, then nodded, like you nod when you realize someone isn't listening. "Okay," he said. "Then at least wait until the gas company comes." He stood. "Promise me that."

I opened my mouth. Nothing came out. Promises are dangerous when you're trying to keep a different one. He took my silence as a no, shook his head, and left the table.

I watched him go and told myself he was dramatic. I told myself he was projecting. I told myself everything I could think of except the thing I didn't want to admit: that he was probably right.

A new email chimed. *Can you deliver by tonight? We need it to schedule.* The brand rep had added a smiley face, as if that made the demand less like a knife.

I stared at it until the letters blurred. My headache pulsed. The room felt smaller. I closed the laptop and stood up because sometimes standing is the only action left before panic.

---

The kitchen in the afternoon had a different kind of light. The sun had moved, throwing bars through the courtyard door that made the tiles look like they were behind prison bars. Maria was sweeping, slow and steady, her broom making a soft whisper against the floor. The smell was worse, or maybe my tolerance was thinner. It filled my throat and sat there like a bad taste.

"You shouldn't be here," Maria said without looking up.

"I'm just getting water," I lied.

She paused, the broom resting on the tiles. "You are always getting water," she said. "You are always in this room." Her English was simple, but the judgment was fluent.

"It's for work," I said. "Photos."

Maria made a sound between a laugh and a cough. "Photos don't save you from fire," she said. She crossed herself again, quick, like someone swatting a fly.

The front door opened and a gust of fresh air blew through the hallway, carrying in city sounds — a tram bell, laughter, the clatter of dishes from the cafe across the street. The contrast made the kitchen smell suddenly, offensively thick.

Joana came in behind the gust, her face set. She was on the phone, speaking fast. The word *agora* cut through her sentences like a siren. She hung up and leaned on the counter, eyes closed.

"They're not coming," she said.

Maria clicked her tongue. "Of course not." She kept sweeping.

"Pedro said he'll call someone else," Joana said. "He says it's not a big leak. He says it's the pipes, the drains, the tourists." She shook her head. "He says it's not his problem." The last words came out like a curse.

I opened the tap and filled a glass. The water smelled faintly of chlorine, a relief. I drank too fast and it made me cough. The cough tasted like gas.

"You should close the kitchen," I said, surprising myself. It was the first time I'd said it out loud.

Joana stared at me, then looked away. "If I close the kitchen, he fires me," she said. "If I don't, someone gets hurt." Her voice cracked on the last word. "He owns the building. He owns the insurance. He owns me."

I had no answer. I stood there with my empty glass and my mouth full of words I didn't say.

Yuki slipped in, small and quiet, carrying her rice cooker. The smell hit her and she flinched, then bowed slightly to Joana in apology for existing in the same room. "Is it safe?" she asked.

Joana hesitated. She looked at Maria. Maria shook her head. Joana looked at me. I looked at the floor. "Open the door," she said finally. "Don't use the stove. Use the microwave." She said it like a script, like a compromise she had memorized.

Yuki nodded and hurried to the microwave, her movements fast and precise. I watched her because it was easier than watching Joana crumble.

"You feel dizzy?" Joana asked me.

"I'm fine," I said, and it was a reflex now. The word felt like lint in my mouth.

She put a hand on my arm, brief and firm. "Go outside. Just for a bit. Please." The word please again, the same shape as this morning, but heavier.

I looked at the tiles, at the light, at the little table by the door that in my head was always a stage. I thought of the email waiting. I thought of the lighter in my pocket. The kitchen hummed around me, the hiss now a thin, relentless thread.

"After I upload," I said, which made no sense because uploading doesn't require being here, but it was something to say.

Joana's hand dropped. "Okay," she said, and her voice went flat, the way a line goes flat when the person saying it has given up.

I left with my empty glass and the smell stuck to me. In the courtyard, the lemon tree was heavy with fruit, too bright, too clean. I breathed in the outside air and felt my lungs loosen. I should have stayed there. I should have taken a photo of the lemon tree and called it a day. Instead I went back upstairs, because my life is a loop and I'm the only one who keeps pressing replay.

The street outside was a palette cleanser. Diesel from the tram, sugar from the bakery, the ocean's damp salt sneaking up the hill. I stood on the sidewalk for a minute too long, blinking like I'd just walked out of a cinema. The sky was that washed-out Lisbon blue, and the rooftops were a pile of terracotta coins. The hostel looked harmless from the outside, all blue tiles and wrought iron, the kind of place you'd tag without ever asking what's behind the wall.

A white van pulled up across the street. It had a logo on the side that looked vaguely official, a swoopy flame icon and the word *Gás* in blue. My heart jumped. I hovered at the curb like a kid waiting for ice cream.

Two men stepped out. They looked bored, not urgent. One of them lit a cigarette and leaned against the van, smoke drifting around him like a joke. The other one glanced up at Casa dos Azulejos, then turned his back and walked into the building next door.

Of course they weren't here. I laughed under my breath, a short, bitter sound. It was ridiculous that I had built a whole hope on a logo and a swoopy flame.

Joana burst through the hostel door, a phone pressed to her ear, her voice sharp. She stopped when she saw the van, eyes narrowing. I watched her cross the street, her steps fast and angry. I couldn't hear what she said, but I could read her body language, the way her hands moved: desperate, specific, pleading. The man with the cigarette shrugged. He pointed at a clipboard. She shook her head. He shrugged again.

She turned and saw me watching. Her face went flat for a second, like she didn't want me to see how small the shrug had made her feel. She walked back across the street and stopped beside me. \"Not for us,\" she said. The words were small.

\"Tomorrow?\" I asked.

She gave me a look that was mostly tired. \"He says tomorrow for three days,\" she said. \"Tomorrow is a cheap word.\" She looked up at the building, then at me. \"Please, Sienna. Don't light anything. Not even for ten seconds.\" The way she said my name made it feel like she had been watching me longer than I thought.

\"Okay,\" I said, and I meant it in that moment because I was out here in clean air and the tiles were far away.

She nodded once, like that's all she could allow herself to believe, and went back inside. I stayed on the curb, watching the van for another beat, as if it might magically be redirected toward us. It wasn't. The cigarette man flicked his ash into the gutter and laughed at something on his phone.

My own phone buzzed. A push notification from Instagram: *Your reel is trending in Lisbon.* The irony tasted like metal. I opened it anyway. The comments were already a mix of hearts and warnings, people telling me to live my best life while also telling me not to die. It's possible to be both supportive and terrified on the internet; it's kind of its main skill.

My head spun, sudden and sharp. I grabbed the edge of a lamppost to steady myself. It passed in a second, leaving only a tired, swimming feeling behind my eyes. Not eating enough, I told myself. Jet lag. Content creator brain. Anything but the thing that would require action.

I walked to the corner pharmacy and bought a packet of aspirin with coins from my jacket. The pharmacist asked if I wanted a bag. I said no and smiled like a tourist who had things under control. I took two tablets dry and let them scrape down my throat. They tasted like chalk and a promise I didn't keep.

Back outside, the van doors slammed. The men were gone. The logo disappeared down the street. Tomorrow slid away with it.

I went back inside with the aspirin rattling in my pocket like tiny dice.

---

By evening, the message from the brand had turned into a countdown. *Need it tonight,* the email said. *Please confirm.* The smiley face was gone. I had one good take, unlit, and a headache that pulsed behind my eyes like a warning light. I lay on my bunk and scrolled through old photos, trying to convince myself that smoke could be faked, that authenticity was a filter, that the difference between a real flame and a staged one was just a caption.

Rafa knocked on the bunk frame with her knuckle. "You okay?" she asked.

"Yeah," I said, the easiest lie.

She climbed onto the mattress beside me, legs tucked under her. "I talked to Joana," she said. "She said the gas company isn't coming. She said Pedro doesn't care." She looked at me like she was looking for a response.

"He cares about money," I said.

"We all do," she said, and it was the truest thing either of us had said in days.

She handed me her phone. On the screen was a video she had shot on the rooftop earlier. It was smoke curling from her cigarette in the sunset, the city soft behind her. "Use this," she said. "We can pretend it's yours. We'll color match. You don't have to light anything."

The offer was a rope. I held it. I imagined using her footage, posting it, telling the brand it was me. I imagined the guilt, the secret, the way it would still look perfect. Then I imagined the comment section: *That's not your hand.* *Why is the ring on the wrong finger?* The internet is a bloodhound for inconsistency. I would be caught. I would be called out. I would be ordinary.

"It's not the same," I said. The words came out automatically, like a reflex. I hated myself for it even as I said it.

Rafa stared at me, and I watched her mouth tighten. "Okay," she said. "Then what?"

"I'll do it tomorrow," I said. The word came out before I could catch it. "Early. When no one is there. I'll keep the door open. Ten seconds."

She let out a long breath. "Ten seconds is how long it takes to make a mistake," she said. She didn't sound like she was quoting anyone. She sounded like she was tired.

I wanted to hug her. I wanted to not be me. I wanted to be the person who says, *You're right.* I wasn't. "It's fine," I said. I could hear the loop in my own voice and still couldn't stop it.

Rafa stood up. "Promise me you'll at least wait until Joana opens the door," she said.

"I will," I said, and this time I meant it. It felt like a compromise. It felt like control.

She nodded, satisfied enough, and left. I lay back and stared at the underside of the top bunk, at the carved initials and old stickers. Someone had scratched a tiny skull into the wood, the kind of doodle you do when you're bored in class. I traced it with my finger and felt a shiver that had nothing to do with the room's cold.

I set my alarm for 6:40 and 6:43 again. I lined up my tools on the nightstand: phone, lighter, cigarette, lip gloss. It looked like a ritual. It looked like a plan.

The hostel settled into night around me. Doors clicked. The shower ran. The faint hiss from downstairs threaded through everything, a sound that had wormed its way into my bones. I closed my eyes and tried to picture the shot: the morning light, the tiles, the curl of smoke. It was beautiful. It was the only thing I could see.

Just before sleep, my phone buzzed one last time. A new comment: *Pls don't smoke in there, sis. Gas smell is no joke.*

I stared at it in the dark. I imagined the stranger behind it, the way their fingers had hovered over the keys with concern. I imagined the word *sis* like a hand on my arm.

I closed the app and turned the phone over. The lighter slid a fraction, the tiny click of plastic on glass. It sounded too loud. It sounded like a countdown.

I told myself: ten seconds.

The hiss from downstairs answered, steady and patient, like it had all the time in the world.
