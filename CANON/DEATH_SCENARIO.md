# Death Scenario

## The Death (Summary)
**Method:** Gas explosion triggered by cigarette lighter in propane-filled kitchen
**Category:** Environmental Hazards
**Duration:** Instantaneous (explosion), 2-3 seconds of consciousness post-ignition
**Witnesses:** Three secondary victims, two survivors in adjacent rooms

## Mechanism (Technical)

### The Cause
Deflagration explosion caused by ignition of propane gas accumulated at explosive concentration (2.1-9.5% by volume). Primary death from blast trauma and thermal injury.

### The Setup
- Old propane system with corroded connector behind stove
- Slow leak developing over 2-3 weeks
- Kitchen poorly ventilated (windows painted shut "for aesthetics")
- Gas accumulated overnight at floor level, rising
- Hostel staff cut corners on maintenance after pandemic losses

### The Trigger
Sienna flicks her BIC lighter to light a cigarette. The spark ignites the propane-air mixture, creating a rapid pressure wave followed by fireball.

### The Process

1. Lighter spark contacts gas at approximately 6:43 AM
2. Ignition begins at spark point, propagates at subsonic speed (deflagration)
3. Pressure wave expands outward at ~300 m/s
4. Windows blow outward, walls flex
5. Fireball follows pressure wave, temperature exceeds 1000C
6. Sienna's body absorbs primary blast - internal organs rupture
7. Hair and clothing ignite
8. Body thrown against far wall
9. Secondary fires begin throughout kitchen
10. Structure compromised, partial ceiling collapse

## Research Notes

- Propane is heavier than air, accumulates at floor level
- Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) for propane: 2.1%
- Flash point: -104C (will ignite at any hostel temperature)
- Gas leak detectors not required by Portuguese building code in older structures
- Similar incidents documented in European hostels: Prague 2015, Athens 2018

## Foreshadowing Checklist

### Part 1 (Subtle Hints)
Plant these without drawing attention:
- [x] Hint 1: Pilot light on stove goes out frequently (mentioned in passing)
- [x] Hint 2: A guest complains about "weird smell" at reception, told it's the drains
- [x] Hint 3: Houseplant in kitchen has inexplicably died
- [x] Hint 4: Brief mention of headache among morning kitchen users

### Part 2 (Obvious Warnings)
These should be noticed but dismissed:
- [x] Warning 1: Distinct rotten egg odor in kitchen - Sienna's rationalization: "European plumbing"
- [x] Warning 2: Staff says "don't use the back burner" without explaining why - Sienna's rationalization: "They're just being difficult"
- [x] Warning 3: Local guest quickly opens window, mutters something in Portuguese - Sienna's rationalization: "Ugh, fresh air ruins the light"
- [x] Warning 4: Sign says "NO SMOKING IN KITCHEN" - Sienna's rationalization: "Rules are for guests, not creators"
- [x] Warning 5: Sienna feels slightly dizzy but attributes it to "not eating enough" - actually early gas exposure

### Part 3 (Explicit Danger)
The threat is now undeniable:
- [x] Moment 1: Gas smell is now overwhelming - Sienna finally notices but thinks "I'll just be quick"
- [x] Moment 2: Hissing sound audible from behind stove
- [x] Moment 3: Lighter is in her hand, thumb on the wheel

## The Death Sequence (Full Detail)

### Setup (Chapter 35-37)
Sienna has been at the hostel for three days, shooting kitchen content every morning. She's noticed the smell but it's become background noise. She's planning her "perfect Portuguese morning" shot - cigarette, espresso, tiles, golden light.

### Trigger (Chapter 38)
At 6:43 AM, the kitchen is empty except for Sienna. Gas has accumulated overnight to approximately 5% concentration - well within explosive range. She's got her ring light set up, phone propped on a coffee cup, espresso steaming beside her (for the shot, she won't drink it). She pulls out her cigarette, her signature move for the "Euro girl" aesthetic.

### The Death (Chapters 39-40)

**Second 0:**
Sienna's thumb rolls the spark wheel. A tiny spark jumps to the wick. In the 0.3 seconds between spark and flame, the propane catches.

**Second 0.3-0.5:**
The world turns white. The explosion is not like movies - there's no slow-motion fireball. There's a CRACK like the universe splitting. The pressure wave hits Sienna's body before she can process what's happening. Her eardrums burst. Her lungs, full of air for a surprised gasp, compress violently.

**Second 0.5-1:**
The fireball follows. Her balayage ignites instantly. Her fast-fashion acrylic sweater melts into her skin. The ring light shatters. Her phone, still recording, captures 0.4 seconds of the explosion before the lens cracks.

**Second 1-2:**
Sienna is thrown backward. She's still technically conscious - the brain takes time to process death. She has a strange, disconnected thought about whether this will get her more followers. It's her last synapse of vanity.

**Second 2-3:**
She hits the tile wall. The beautiful azulejos - the reason she chose this hostel - crack under the impact. Her skull fractures on contact. Consciousness ends.

**Final Moment:**
Sienna Rose Blackwood, @SiennaWanders, becomes a body. The fire continues. Her phone, remarkably, survives another 30 seconds before the battery ignites. The footage will never be recovered, but the thumbnail - a frozen frame of white light - will haunt the internet.

### Immediate Aftermath
The explosion blows out the kitchen windows onto the narrow Lisbon street below. Two other guests in the kitchen - a Japanese backpacker making rice and a Brazilian student grabbing water - die within seconds. A fourth person, Australian surfer Dylan, survives with severe burns because he was behind the refrigerator.

Fire spreads to the common room. Evacuation is chaotic. Three more injured, one critically. Fire department arrives in 11 minutes. The hostel is gutted. International news picks it up because of Sienna's influencer status. Her follower count spikes to 2 million posthumously.

## Sensory Details

### Sight
- Flash of white, brighter than any ring light
- Orange and blue fire simultaneously
- Glass becoming projectiles, sparkling in the fireball
- The last thing Sienna sees: the flame of her lighter, microscopically large, then infinite

### Sound
- Initial: A CRACK that's felt more than heard
- Ears ringing immediately, all other sound muted
- Distant: glass shattering, screaming, car alarms
- The sound of fire eating oxygen

### Touch/Pain
- Pressure wave like being hit by a wall
- Heat - not gradual, instant, total
- Then absence - nerve endings destroyed too fast to transmit pain
- Final impact against wall

### Smell
- Propane has a rotten egg smell (mercaptan added for detection)
- Then burning hair, synthetic fabric, flesh
- Ozone and smoke

### Taste
- Metallic (blood from burst capillaries)
- Chemical burning in throat

## The Horror Element
The horror is the speed and the stupidity. Sienna dies doing something she's done a thousand times - lighting a cigarette for a photo. The horror is that she never understood the danger, never even knew she was dying. The horror is three innocent people dying because she wanted content.

## The Comedy Element
Dark irony: She wanted to be famous. She got her wish - posthumously. Her engagement rate finally went through the roof. The explosion was literally the most-viewed content she ever created. "Died doing what she loved" takes on grotesque meaning. She finally went viral.

## Secondary Victims

| Name | Relationship to Main Victim | Death |
|------|---------------------------|-------|
| Yuki Tanaka | No relationship, making breakfast | Died instantly, blast trauma |
| Lucas Oliveira | No relationship, getting water | Died within minutes, burns |
| Dylan Cooper | Acquaintance, in blast radius | Survived, 3rd degree burns, 40% body |

## The Cover-Up (if any)
No cover-up possible - explosion is too public. Investigation reveals:
- Gas company had no record of inspection in 3 years
- Hostel owner faces criminal negligence charges
- Insurance doesn't cover "guest negligence" (cigarette), legal battle ensues
- Portuguese authorities conduct hostel safety sweep, find 40+ violations citywide

## @HostelReaper Connection
- Graffiti found (spray-painted on rubble after demolition): "SHE WANTED TO GO VIRAL #002"
- Social media post: Photo of a lighter with caption "Some content is to die for. Literally. #NoSmokingMeansNoSmoking #GasLeakAwareness"
- Other: Sienna's final, unposted story draft (recovered from cloud): a boomerang of her lighter flicking, never uploaded

## Writing Notes

### Pacing the Death
- Slow build showing Sienna's obliviousness over multiple mornings
- Death itself in real-time, stretched subjectively
- Extensive aftermath - this death has body count and consequences

### POV During Death
- In Sienna's head until consciousness ends
- Shift to omniscient for the explosion's spread
- Survivor POV (Dylan) for aftermath

### Graphic Content Level
- 8/10: This is a violent, public death with multiple casualties
- Show: the explosion, the immediate aftermath, the burns
- Imply: the detailed state of bodies, the worst of the injuries
