## The Staff

### Reception
**Name:** Joana Ferreira
**Description:** 28, architecture student working part-time, knows the building is problematic, reported issues to owner twice, was dismissed
**Role in death:** Warning-giver - told guests not to use the back burner, didn't explain why (told not to by owner)

### Other Staff
| Role | Name | Notable Trait |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cleaner | Maria Santos | 62, suspicious of stove, brings own electric kettle, never uses gas |
| Security | None | N/A |
| Bar/Kitchen | None | Self-serve |
| Manager/Owner | Pedro Almeida | 55, bought property in 2011, cares more about aesthetics than safety, cut corners post-COVID |

### Staff Knowledge
Joana reported the gas smell three months ago. Owner said "it's just the old pipes" and refused to pay for inspection. Maria crosses herself every time she walks past the kitchen. Previous near-incident (pilot light blowing out, room filling with gas) was hushed up with a free night's stay for the guest involved.
