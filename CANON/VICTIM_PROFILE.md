# Victim Profile

## Basic Information

**Full Name:** Sienna Rose Blackwood
**Nickname/Handle:** @SiennaWanders (142K followers)
**Age:** 24
**Nationality:** British (Essex, but tells people "London")
**Occupation:** "Full-time content creator" (actually: unemployed, funded by credit cards)

## Archetype
**Primary:** Instagram Influencer

**Secondary traits:**
- Desperate for validation
- Aesthetic-obsessed to the point of blindness
- Secretly deeply insecure

## The Fatal Flaw
**Core Flaw:** Vanity

**How it manifests:**
- Cannot experience anything without documenting it
- Ignores surroundings while framing shots
- Dismisses real dangers if they're not "aesthetic"

**How it kills them:**
Sienna is so focused on capturing the perfect "morning coffee ritual" content that she ignores the distinct smell of gas in the kitchen. When she lights a cigarette for her "European cafe moment" shot, she ignites the accumulated propane, creating an explosion that kills her instantly.

## Physical Appearance
- **Height/Build:** 5'6", carefully maintained "slim thick" figure
- **Hair:** Balayage blonde, always camera-ready, extensions
- **Distinguishing features:** Lip filler, microbladed brows, matching tattoo with her "best friend" (who she hasn't spoken to in two years)
- **Typical outfit:** Fast fashion that looks expensive, matching sets, always heels even when walking cobblestones

## Personality

### Positive Traits (that get twisted)
1. Creative eye for composition - becomes obsession that blinds her to danger
2. Hardworking (posts 3x daily) - becomes inability to ever be present

### Negative Traits (that seal their fate)
1. Completely disconnected from physical reality - leads to ignoring gas smell
2. Addicted to external validation - means she won't stop shooting even when uncomfortable

### Pet Peeves
- Bad lighting (the irony)
- People who don't "get" content creation
- Being asked what her "real job" is

### Fears
- Surface fear: Irrelevance, losing followers
- Deeper fear: That she's ordinary, that her parents were right

## Background

### Origin Story
Grew up in a small Essex town she found suffocating. Average student, pretty but not prettiest. Discovered Instagram at 16 and found the validation she craved. Dropped out of university to pursue "the dream." Parents cut her off financially; she maxed out three credit cards to keep traveling, believing the sponsorships would come.

### Why They Travel
Travel content is the most aspirational niche. She travels because it's what successful influencers do, not because she's genuinely curious about places. Every destination is a backdrop, not a destination.

### How They Ended Up at This Hostel
Chose this Lisbon hostel because it has a "gorgeous tiled kitchen" that appears on Pinterest. Perfect for her "European slow living" content pivot. Didn't read reviews mentioning the gas smell.

## Voice & Speech

### Vocabulary
- Uses words like: "aesthetic," "vibe," "literally," "obsessed," "iconic," "slay," "ate and left no crumbs"
- Avoids words like: "I don't know," "ordinary," "trying"
- Catchphrases: "Living my best life," "This is everything," "I'm manifesting it"

### Speech Pattern
- Uptalk constantly, even on statements
- Inserts "like" every few words
- Switches to posh accent for videos
- Actually quite articulate when not performing

### Internal Monologue Style
Constant narration in future captions. Evaluating every moment for its "content potential." Beneath it, a quieter voice that she drowns out with posting.

## Digital Presence

### Social Media
- **Platform of choice:** Instagram (primary), TikTok (growing)
- **Follower count:** 142,000 (35% bots she bought during a dark period)
- **Posting style:** Curated "effortless European" aesthetic, lots of coffee, tiles, golden hour
- **Last post before death:** A reel of her walking through Lisbon with text overlay "POV: You finally found yourself" - posted 43 minutes before explosion

### Online vs Reality
Her grid shows peaceful mornings with artisanal coffee. Reality: she's stressed, broke, hasn't had a real conversation in weeks, drinks instant coffee but photographs the cafe's cup. The "loving partner" occasionally in shots is hired from Fiverr.

## Relationships

### Family
- Parents: Disappointed. Stopped lending money after the third "I'm about to get a huge brand deal" that never happened
- Sister: Thinks she's embarrassing, doesn't follow her

### Friends
- Has "content friends" - collaborations only
- Former best friend blocked her after Sienna tried to sell her on a pyramid scheme

### Romantic
- Single, pretends boyfriends don't exist because it "limits her brand"
- Actually deeply lonely

### At the Hostel
- Annoyed roommates by setting up ring light for 5 AM "morning routine" content
- Connected briefly with a German photographer but made it transactional immediately
- Staff find her demanding but harmless

## The Day They Die

### Morning
Woke at 4:47 AM to catch "golden hour" light. Did full makeup in the dark while roommates slept. Spent an hour finding the perfect cafe but didn't like the coffee, just the cups.

### Their Last Normal Moment
Walking into the hostel kitchen, phone in one hand, cigarette in the other. Noticing the beautiful morning light hitting the azulejo tiles. Thinking "this is going to be so good."

### Final Thoughts
"Wait, what's that sme--" Her last actual thought before the flash was that the explosion would probably ruin her hair.

### Last Words
"Oh my god, the LIGHT in here--" (mid-sentence, reaching for her lighter)
